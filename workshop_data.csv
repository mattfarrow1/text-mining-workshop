305683957,5,2015-08-01,Portugal,"I  ve previously been to 3 Disney Resorts. So I had my expectations sky high for the original park. And they were more than fulfilled. Even so it is a smaller park than many of its counterparts it had that magical feeling almost like you can ran into Walt itself when strolling trough main street. Reserve a day to get to know this park and some of its  can not miss  attractions like haunted mansion, pirates of the Caribbean, peter pans flight, space mountain, splash mountain and finish day with the astonishing paint the night parade.",Disneyland_California
666364898,3,2018-10-01,United States,"The Hong Kong Disneyland is quite small, there are too many people and the waiting line is long. it took average one hour or more in the line. however, the transit Disneyland tram is very nice, very impressive!",Disneyland_HongKong
293082325,3,2015-06-01,United States,"My wife, my 15 year old son, and I went to Disneyland Park on June 30, 2015; a hot, sunny, 95 degree day.We knew that two main attractions were down; Space Mountain and I can't remember the other one. What made this visit so average was all of the technical difficulties they had on the other rides. We went to Pirates of the Caribbean and couldn't get in because they were having technical difficulties so come back later. We went to Phantom Manor and couldn't get in because they were having technical difficulties so come back later. We went to Buzz Lightyear and there was a one hour wait so we got a FastPass. We went back at the stated time couldn't get in because they were having technical difficulties so come back later. This happened over and over.We won't be going back.",Disneyland_Paris
334650140,1,2015-11-01,United Kingdom,"Our family had the unfortunate experience of being in Paris on the weekend of 13th   16th November during the tragic terrorist attacks.We purchased 3 day tickets for Disneyland Paris, we used these on 13 11 but obviously were unable to use these on the Saturday and Sunday as the parks were understandably closed. In the wider scheme of things our weekend being different than expected was not an issue, however I am very disappointed in Disney who are refusing to refund on the unused tickets stating that it is not within the terms and conditions. We have been to Disney parks on many occasions but a global organisation with children at it's centre aiming to profit from tragedy is disgusting and as such we will never return.",Disneyland_Paris
393553042,3,2016-07-01,United States,HK Disney is very small and lines for the big attractions are long. We did enjoy our day and took in a few attractions and the Lion King Show. We really enjoyed the Philharmagic 3 D movie!,Disneyland_HongKong
175685909,5,2013-08-01,United Kingdom,Nothing but fun fun fun! had a brilliant time with my son and Fiancee for my birthday! everybody is happy with great senses of humor and had a fantastic day on my birthday. The parade was brilliant and shocked my 2 year old son but we have great video footage and pictures for great memories. Was a wonderful day in a magical place ahhh!,Disneyland_Paris
150353289,5,2013-01-01,India,Should not miss the Disney Flights Parade.. Wow wonderful to see the characters live and kids will be mesmerized. Due to new year season we experienced tooooo much crowd and queues in every point of Disneyland.,Disneyland_HongKong
224797068,5,2014-08-01,United Kingdom,"everything   i am disney mad !!!  very busy in august, plan your days !!  best place to eat is the plaza gardens ( see my review)",Disneyland_Paris
310708679,5,2015-04-01,United Kingdom,"Wow! What a great experience! We went back in April 2015 and travelled with a group of 7 adults and 4 children. We had a 2 day pass to the parks, maybe could have done with another day in the park (we did both the Disney Studios and Disneyland Paris) but did get to see and do a lot. 2 of our group were seniors and We hired a wheelchair as the park is big and a lot of walking around. Wheelchair was easy to hire and we had it for 2 days (taking it back to the hotel each night). The park is lovely. Lots going on and lots to see and do. Staff are all friendly and always willing to help.The children in our party are aged between 2   4 and there was lots and lots for them. (My daughter especially liked 'it's a small world' ride   I lost count the among of times we went on it!) We didn't queue for a lot but think that was because of the time of year we went (not in holidays). My mum and dad were given a fast pass which they used to go on the train ride around the park and avoided the queues. I did notice the fast pass entrances to the rides were empty so people with them didn't have to queue at all, but maybe it was due to the time of year we went. There are a variety of places to get food in the park, pizza, chicken & chips, sandwiches and the usual snacks   ice cream, waffles etc. Prices are a little more than you may expect, but we didn't find it too bad. You can also go to the Disney Village to get food where there is a macdonalds, Planet Hollywood and Starbucks among others. We took snacks with us for the little ones   packed a cool bag each day so avoided having to keep buying crisps juice etc. Although did buy 3 tubs of popcorn and a bag of Doritos which set me back nearly    20! Lots and lots of Disney shops within the park   all selling the same stuff and a bit more expensive I found. The parade is really good, all the Disney characters parade around the park on amazing floats. The light show in the evening is amazing too. Well worth staying in the park until closing time to see! I've never been to USA Disney so can't really compare it but I would defiantly go back here. Disney really is the most magical place on earth!",Disneyland_Paris
126717664,5,2012-03-01,United States,"I loved everything! :)  It's the Happiest Place on Earth, you know?",Disneyland_California
118802079,5,2011-09-01,United States,I went there with 2 daughters   1 y.o. and 4 y.o. Both of them were very excited. Little one liked most of the rides (the only one she didn't like was  It's a little world . It was too long for her. Older one was super happy to see the real princesses :),Disneyland_California
174308145,3,2013-08-01,United Kingdom,The two parks are within easy walking distance of each other. if you plan your days properly you can get fast passes for both parks to get the most of your time there. Can get very busy and crowded in peak season. A lot of characters walking around to meet and greet. The park offers a typical Disney experience but as we only Visited the Orlando parks last year we felt that this was worth the visit but not a patch on the Walt Disney World!If you want to drink alcohol at this Disney and you are not an American citizen you also have to carry your passport around with you as they will not accept an EU driving license.,Disneyland_California
136041197,3,2012-02-01,United Kingdom,"This is nothing compare to Disneyland in Florida. The weather is cold, the queues are long and ridiculous, you need a reservation for dinner. The park is not managed well.I found staff in Disneyland Paris to be very rude and a little racist. This would never happen in the US,   they are a lot more friendly there.The stewards that escort the Disney charactors around the park never smile and again aren't really cut out for their job.",Disneyland_Paris
192562490,5,2014-01-01,Australia,"This place is the epitome of Disney. You smell Disney, with a maple like smell piped through the park. You see Disney when you look at the architectural feats in the park. You hear Disney in the live performances. But mostly you feel the joy of Disney, and childhood nostalgia, when you are there. Grizzly Gulch has an incredible rollercoaster that my kids couldnt get enough of. Food was relatively well priced (for a theme park) and there was a pretty good variety too. It is incredibly clean.You just feel happy being here. Highly reccomend",Disneyland_HongKong
512395501,4,2017-07-01,United States,"Went to Shanghai Disneyland what a big difference when we went to Hong Kong Disneyland. It's like night and day!! Less crowded the people are not rude, no cutting lines everyone waits their turn. Really enjoyed seeing the Tarzan play it highlighted the Chinese acrobatic talent. That was probably my favorite show at Disneyland. Because it is not crowded we were able to see and cover more of the park in less hours. We only had time for about half day   4 hours and it was plenty enough time to cover what we wanted to see and do. All in all this is a pleasant experience and worth going to visit despite everyone saying it's so small and not worth it. Believe it I enjoyed myself here more than Shanghai Disneyland. Thumbs up for Hong Kong Disneyland and the people have more class here and wait patienty their turn.",Disneyland_HongKong
124811435,3,2012-02-01,United Kingdom,"Half term at Disneyland Paris is not for the feint hearted, a birthday treat for the kids it may have been, but definitely became an exercise in maintaining parental boundaries and discipline. I honestly don   t think I have seen so many chastised kids in one place! Basically this is a total retail experience with a few fairground attractions thrown in. Granted the kids loved seeing the characters and it certainly toughened them up to a more continental approach to the notion of queuing and taking your turn but increasingly as the days passed the whole experience became clearly over priced enticement to buy Disney products. Both Disneyland and Walt Disney Studios have limited rides for toddlers & younger children and all have long queues for a very short ride. The birthday tea party with the characters cost   17 per person (Kids & Adults alike) for that we got coffee, juice and a selection of pastries & marshmallows. The additional Birthday cake cost a further   31 (Booked through Disneydirect). It was a perfectly nice chocolate cake but certainly not a   31 cake! We put all that aside and accepted that like everything else the Disney mark up and increased costs in France played there part. The parks themselves were not fully open and many areas were being repaired or constructed, this certainly didn   t promote the magical experience promised. Our youngest was very confused that all the characters spoke French first and then English this was slightly distracting when trying to suspend his disbelief. While the hotel Cheyenne that we stayed in was comfortable and clean, the dinning arrangements were not an enjoyable experience. The Chuck Wagon cafe provided a buffet style arrangement that involved long queues again despite the laughable encouragement to reserve a table????. Once in the buffet area a free for all ensued which trying to navigate with two kids was a complete nightmare, then locate a free and cleared table to settle everyone to finally eat. Breakfasts were much the same. Oh and If you want a coffee in your room you will need to buy the  tea basket  7e for two tea bags, two coffee sachets, 4 UHT milk pots, 4 sugars and 4 Disney biscuits. I wasn   t naive enough to think that the magic kingdom was really as glossy and wonderful as its adverts would have you believe, however I wasn   t quite prepared to feel as though I'd been totally fleeced by a mouse.My advice if you really want the kids to experience Disney, then go to Florida, at least there   s less chance it will be cold and rainy.",Disneyland_Paris
234839532,5,2014-07-01,United Kingdom,"Been to Disneyland Paris in July 2014 with the family. Had an absolute blast of a time. Took the Eurostar out of London St Pancras. Had to change over locally onto a TGV coach which heads straight into the heart of the park in Marne la Vallee station. We had a package deal including travel, hotel and theme park reservation. They have 7 Disney hotels to suit various budgets. There are loads more in the vicinity which are cheaper and provide great deals including entry tickets to the park and to and fro coach drops. We stayed at The Disney New York Hotel which is the second priciest one on the grounds. Great hotel with excellent facilities, friendly staff and very helpful concierge facilities. I would strongly recommend enrolling for the Buffet breakfast as it is brilliant and is a great start to the day. Once your topped up, all you need is a snack here and there to see you through the day till dinner time. Also topping yourself up ensures that you do not feel sick on the rides   Contrary to popular belief. Staying at the Disney Hotels has the added benefit of a walking distance to the park with early entry an hour before opening. (CAUTION: Not all the big rides are available during this period, but it is still worth it  you could easily get 4   8 great rides depending on how eager and lucky you are)The rides are great and there is always something for everyone. Queues can get long between rides at peak times and you can book 1 ride at a time for fast pass entry. As my wife and daughter were not eager on any of the big rides   it was down to me and my son double fast passing rides on their tickets. Adjacent to the park by its side is the Walt Disney studios, which is a must see but not as impressive as the park.The firework displays in the evening is an absolute must see.Visiting Paris is easy as there are trains from the local station heading into Paris (approximately 30 minutes). So if Disney Florida is too distant a dream then Paris is the answer. I am sure you are bound to enjoy it. As I said there is always something for everyone to do.",Disneyland_Paris
247838261,4,2014-12-01,Austria,The whole park is beautifully made and just a childs dream. (You have to look at all the details). You can expect to wait averagely 30 Minutes for a ride. But its a thing I  d like to experience again and again.,Disneyland_Paris
239683154,5,2014-10-01,United States,It's always a blast going back to Disney. It's where adults can be kids again. Take your kids and watch them smile. Go on a weekday and try it in October during their Halloween themed nights and you'll be talking about it for a while. Staff is always nice.,Disneyland_California
217900614,5,2014-07-01,New Zealand,"Nobody loves queuing so arriving early in Fantasyland and having no queue at all for the Peter Pan and Snow White rides was awesome.. staying late at night is worthwhile as we could go on Pirates of the Caribbean a few extra times, and Splash Mountain is something else at night! Lots of people leave after Fantasmic, so stay and enjoy the park for the next hour and a half!",Disneyland_California
141923872,4,2012-09-01,Canada,First time going... but hopefully not the last! Tons to see and do! Worth the money for sure. Tip: Get the southern California City pass,Disneyland_California
146606112,4,2012-11-01,Guam,Getting there was pretty simple.  It's a good day tour specially with kids (or kids at heart).  Lots of fun and lots to see and do.  Souvenir shops abound (kinda pricey) but it's Disney!,Disneyland_HongKong
480680524,4,2017-04-01,United States,"We have been to both Disney parks and this is much better.  The rides are a lot closer, it is not as crowded, and it doesn't require a week.  If you are getting a fast pass get one for Indiana Jones or Space Mountain first...More",Disneyland_California
284693982,5,2014-09-01,United States,"I AM COMPARING BOTH FLORIDA AND CALIFORNIA'S DISNEY PARK,  Yes , Florida is bigger but bigger is not better. I like the original it does have more to offer me as an older 60 year old kid.",Disneyland_California
427522572,5,2016-10-01,Australia,Even after all these years Disneyland is a special place to visit.  The crowds are huge but it is worth the visit.,Disneyland_California
445582847,3,2016-07-01,India,"Its good but quite kiddish. Its basically for kids below 12 years, not worth for teenagers. We visited it as my daughter didn't want to leave Hongkong without visiting disneyland",Disneyland_HongKong
146155234,5,2012-11-01,United States,"Eventhough it was November Christmas season had just begun. Out of all my visits to the park this season was a first for me.  It is now my favorite time to visit the park. I love the decorations, parades and the feel overall!",Disneyland_California
630573436,2,2018-10-01,United Kingdom,"Before entering the park we were greeted by French armed forces and police which although made you feel safe also didn   t since there was a random amount of beggars and illegal sellers of counterfeit souvenirs along with people trying to get you to give them your Disney tickets to get in (this happened a couple of times when entering and leaving). Once past security you have to walk through the Disneyland hotel which as it was raining the floor was extremely slippy and unsafe dangerous, we saw no signs telling people to be careful due to the floors and even saw someone fall and hurt themselves as a result of the water.Once up to the main entrance people were trying to use rfid cards that don   t work very well (not like Florida which has magic bands which we have never had problems with). Inside the park felt dated and disappointing and felt like an extremely cheap version of a Disney location. The queues for rides was very long and when you did get there the cast members we unhelpful, ignorant and arrogant. We paid extra to go to the Halloween 2018 event and found it disappointing, once in we were forced down a path and away from Main Street until we got to an open area which had no lights and signs so became quite lost as allot of areas were closed off at this time. We tried to walk to get to some rides and ended up walking round in circles round structures like Hyperspace mountain because of the no lights situation and lack of signs. In all the event and even normal days just felt unorganised with cast members looking at you in disgust and never smiling or being helpful. We had purchased the photo pass as part of our package however only saw a couple of character points and no photographers around, at other parks in the USA there are photographers everywhere taking pictures in notable areas that would make good memory pictures in Disneyland Paris you get none of this and it just felt like a waste of the additional    69.99. We were soo disappointed and won   t be going back to Disneyland Paris after the ignorant, arrogant and downright rude staff, it felt like you were putting them out by asking to purchase food, souvenirs or by trying to go on a ride. It felt unorganised and you didn   t know what to do or where to go most of the time. Through all our time here we just felt like we were putting them out by being in Disneyland Paris, I couldn   t tell people to ever go as it was just disappointing and we came away feeling like we had wasted a huge amount of money.",Disneyland_Paris
142630708,5,2012-05-01,United Kingdom,"This is a great place to go for a short break   it is obviously more convienent money and travel wise than Disney Florida and it only really shows if you have been to Florida first. It has a Wow factor more aimed at the slightly younger generation and it is easy to get around and the wait for the rides wasn't too bad   but at the end of the day if you are looking to beat Disney Florida   this won't cut it! If you are never going to go to Florida, this is an amazing family holiday!",Disneyland_Paris
386783306,4,2015-09-01,Australia,Have been here twice now  13 years apart and as an adult it is still fun to go and spend the day there. Worth the money and a fun day out with family or friends.,Disneyland_California
180537740,5,2013-09-01,United States,"Disney is a Wonder Land every day of the year. Season change, decorations change, but everyone who works there is always pleasant. I would rather spend time with my family at Disney than spend it with relatives. It is a chance to be a kid again, no matter how old you are.Sometimes 3 day passes are just not long enough, so my family bought a yearly pass and visited Disney 5 times in one year. Every trip was fun and exciting. We are very sad that our year passes are over.",Disneyland_California
314986903,5,2015-03-01,United Kingdom,"We went during Swing into Spring, I loved it I did, it was so flowery and just delightful, Disneyland Paris suffers with being severely underrated, everyone goes on about how Florida is the 'real' Disney (despite the fact California is in fact the first park.) and how DLP doesn't come close, but theres so much fun to be had at DLP, Definitely worth a visit.Spring itself has lots of fun offerings, a Spring Fever show with Goofy, Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy, Pluto, Horace Horsecollar, Clarabelle Cow, Chip, Dale, Clarice, Gepetto, Pinocchio, Stitch, Woody, Jessie, Pooh, Eeyore, Tigger, Rabbit, Piglet, Alice, Mad Hatter, Tweedle Dum, Tweedle Dee and many more fun characters.Theres a Mary Poppins show on Castle Stage with all sorts of fun!Minnies Little Spring Train was great, the song was so catchy and I still find myself singing it now 7 months later!There were meets with a special themed Minnie Mouse, Thumper and Miss Bunny especially for that theme (although Thumper and Miss Bunny will return for Christmas) and the park had 4 large topiary's of The Lion King, Bambi, 101 Dalmatians and Aristocats.I wouldn't choose Spring over Summer, however Spring was excellent, if you can make a visit, its definitely worth it!",Disneyland_Paris
296705881,4,2015-08-01,United Kingdom,"The above title speaks volumes! We had a great time. Having visited Florida, I imagined Paris to be the poor relation, but how wrong I was. Staff work hard to make it a happy experience and there is a joyful atmosphere   well, how couldn't there be?! Great shops, food and attractions. Can't wait to go back.",Disneyland_Paris
515620167,1,2017-08-01,United States,The worst place with kids to visit they were over priced in about 4 hours we were done it's too small for the price they charge not enough the one in ORLANDO it's 100 times better,Disneyland_California
426568126,4,2016-10-01,United Kingdom,"Great trip   Well worth staying to the light display which is 8pm on week nights and 10pm on Saturday & Sunday. Pirates of the Caribbean was fantastic (avoid the Blue Lagoon Restaurant which is visible from this ride), Peter Pan is great as well... Lost a star as the staff are generally moody looking & little unapproachable. Not the disney way!",Disneyland_Paris
636750114,3,2018-11-01,United States,"We visited the week after Thanksgiving, as we read that crowds are lower then, but we definitely did not find that to be the case. The place was packed! And, unfortunately, many of the rides were unexpectedly down for good chunks of the day. We really visited to see the Haunted Mansion, because I love the Nightmare Before Christmas overlay, but it was closed most of the day. We were only able to ride it once. Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain experienced intermittent closures throughout the day as well. Very disappointing.We bought the Maxpass, and we found the Disneyland app to be very buggy. It kept shutting down, then we'd have to re enter the password again and again. It didn't really matter, because by noon, almost all the fast passes were gone for the popular rides, so I'm not sure we got our money's worth.We found the same problem as others did    aggressive parents steering their mammoth strollers over our feet and into the backs of our legs. One parent came straight at me and almost took me out at the knees! I really wish they only allowed single file strollers, as there were some that sat two or three seats across, and they took up the whole sidewalk.All in all, it was an okay day.",Disneyland_California
125612907,4,2012-02-01,United States,Our whole family loves it everytime we visit!  Friendly customer service.  Very clean park and restrooms.  Fun rides and attractions.  Wonderful memories.  Sometimes the lines are very long though.  Food and the park are over priced.,Disneyland_California
190365926,5,2014-01-01,Australia,"Disneyland is by far a wonderful experience! Having been to the Disneyland in Paris, I was curious to see how the  real  Disneyland would compare. Nothing beats going to the Disneyland in Anaheim. Being the original Disneyland, this park just has so many things to take in and do, even if you aren't a ride enthusiast. The Fireworks and Light and Colour Show are awesome, as is the parade, although thats better at the 5.30pm session as its night and more lights and flash at this time. It was really cool to be there at Xmas New Year time as everything is Xmas themed, and has a whole new feel to it. Its really fun to go around and meet all the characters from your favourite childhood shows and just experience the magic of Disneyland. It really is the happiest place on earth.",Disneyland_California
551457690,5,2017-10-01,Thailand,I love here. There are many things to do here.   Be noted that it's clouded every where here with all games and teaters.   To purcase the fast track is recommended.  Stay until late to see the fire work.  Iron man is value to wait.,Disneyland_HongKong
278627765,5,2014-10-01,United States,I always love Disneyland. Best Rides and atmosphere ever! We could easily spend several days here alone!,Disneyland_California
517180923,4,2017-08-01,United Kingdom,Too much to do and we ran out of time. We concentrated more on the characters as my daughter has complex needs and loved them. The parade was magical along with the firework display.,Disneyland_Paris
314498580,5,2015-06-01,Australia,"Having been to Disneyland in Anaheim, Hong Kong's Disneyland is the exact same magical place.  Wonderful for children and adults.  There is something to make everyone smile and feel happy.  Certainly recommend it if you have a day night spare in Honkers.",Disneyland_HongKong
177976337,5,2013-09-01,United Kingdom,The parks were brilliant loved them both and would go again.  The new cars ride in cars land is fantastic.   Use the single rider lane ( so much  quicker )  September was great because it was less busy and still warm,Disneyland_California
403906456,5,2016-08-01,Canada,We have been coming every summer for several years and we always come to Disney! Yes there are large crowds and heat but we take it all in and have a good time! We get on the rides that we like and do single rider and or fast pass. At the Jolly Bakery near I buy a Matterhorn Macaroon very delicious! We buy the 3 day hopper ticket prior at AMA that is a bit cheaper than at the park.,Disneyland_California
524512869,5,2017-09-01,Saudi Arabia,"first of all, it's not as small as everyone is saying. it is huge and worth the visit! most of the rides designed for families of all ages to try and the other ones they allow kids if accompanied by parents.the shows are amazing .happy happy vibes must visit!",Disneyland_HongKong
156541281,5,2013-01-01,Canada,"This is the original Disney theme park and although smaller than Disney World Florida, this park has much to offer. After being in New Orleans only 3 months earlier I was pleased to see New Orleans square as it Walt Disney sent his artists to the french quarter to capture the architecture during talks of demolishing the quarter. The artists did the real french quarter justice when they planned this section of disneyland. I did notice that the rides are fewer but they are longer than disney world. The only negative part of this experience was that the haunted mansion and thunder mountain were closed for repairs while we were there.",Disneyland_California
566992906,3,2018-03-01,Singapore,Many places were closed for renovations. However the children enjoyed the new Ironman experience. Long waiting time for most photo shoots & rides. The park should impose a non smoking rule as the guests are mainly children.,Disneyland_HongKong
479062963,5,2017-04-01,India,"Great entertainment park, a day is not enough to cover all the attractions do an online booking and be there as early as possible to avoid long que. Meet different Walt disney characters and expect long waiting obviously there are fast pass to avoid.The best is the Ratatouille ride... Enjoy!!",Disneyland_Paris
573106756,5,2018-04-01,Switzerland,Amazing Themepark!!!  Definitely a most do in LA!!  I totally can recommend the Cars Ride  I was disappointed by Pirates of the Caribbean   Bring your Pick Nick if you don   t want to spend 15$ per meal,Disneyland_California
234450127,5,2014-10-01,Australia,"We visited middle of week, caught the train in and were there first thing. Must admit we thought the kids would be cooked by 3 4pm but they had such a fabulous day we stayed till 8pm!! Kids loved the rides such as the parachute drop, buzz light year ride and the adventure land cruise. Prices were very reasonable for Disney and very little wait times for rides on the day we went. All in all highly recommended for families. Our kids 6 and 9 loved it!!!!",Disneyland_HongKong
310496769,4,2015-09-01,United Kingdom,"Disney was fantastic! not even the rain could dampen our day! the only reason I don't give it 5 stars, is because of the smoking situation in the park. There are many smoking points people are meant to use, away from people, but most people just light up while queuing for rides, it was disgusting to see no Disney staff stopping this! and suffering peoples 2nd hand smoke, just glad I didn't have children with me.",Disneyland_Paris
244577321,4,2014-12-01,Thailand,"Great atmosphere, bueatiful set up and surroundings and staff helpful & happy. If you have children ages 5 to 12 its a must visit. Not many thrill seeker rides for the seasoned theme park veteran though you will find the lines shortest on the most fun of rides (my daughter and i loved the runaway mine cars the most). Even on a weekday average lines are over 30 minutes though setting is nice and time waiting passes quickly. Getting to and from the park is quick & easy. A few rides seem very short in ride time for the length of the wait getting on. I also think the characters could come out to see the kids more, we managed 1 photo session in our 7 our visit and saw only 2 others with the lines already closed.",Disneyland_HongKong
262533229,5,2015-03-01,United States,"We took my daughters friend who had never been to Disneyland, what a blast!  A bit bummed to have Critter Country and the Matterhorn closed.  It was crowded but it was also spring break.  Always fun, always amazing!",Disneyland_California
212645275,3,2014-06-01,United States,"My daughters and I visited Disneyland Paris for the first time and were a little disappointed. Living in Florida and having DisneyWorld in our backyard I was careful not to hold Disneyland Paris to the standards of the U.S. park so we went in with open minds. I knew it was a scaled down version of DisneyWorld so we approached everything with that in mind, however there was something missing from this park... the Disney Magic!! The castle was beautiful and loved being able to walk around on the inside and enjoyed seeing Disneyland Paris versions of some of the attractions we have at Disneyworld. We really enjoyed the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Carribean. Space Mountain was closed down, which I knew before we went, but it seemed like maybe June is their off season, because a lot of restaurants and food vendors were also closed. The employees just didn't seem to have the  cast member  attitude we have experienced at DisneyWorld. We did a Disneyland Express tour from Paris which is endorsed by DisneyLand Paris. Am I glad we went... yes so that I can say I did, would we go back... probably not.",Disneyland_Paris

It is located on an alley near a bakery on Main St. be sure to bring change of clothes cause I saw that most of people get drenched in sweat here. My fav attractions was the grizzly gulch roller coaster, I rode that 6 times! And it's got single rider, it really helped cut the queue! Tommorowland, Mystic Manor, and RC Racer are worth to try as well!",Disneyland_HongKong

Very fun with lots of fun rides, I loved the teacup ride, I'd been wanting to go on it since I was little :) Make sure to stay for the fireworks at night, they are amazing!Plenty of food options even for vegetarian and health conscious which was good.

323954341,4,2015-10-01,United States,We booked in October because we thought it was a slow time for Disneyland. It was just as busy as any other time we've been there. We didn't realize there were Halloween parties just about every night we could have participated in. The wait times on the big rides were still long and it was crowded. We also didn't check the height requirements on the rides and it turns out our 3 year old was an inch too short for many of them.,Disneyland_California
172710445,5,2013-08-01,United Kingdom,"Just came back from disneyland and the whole family loved it! Yes it is busy and there are queues (which some of the rude French cannot seem to grasp the concept of), but if you are aware of this before you go you are ready for it. Food not as expensive as people make out, and staff are great. Most of the rides have the fast pass facility which you don't need to pay for, however, we missed some of the rides out as they didn't have the facility and wait time was 2 hours. There are signs at entrance to rides giving approx wait times though so at least you can make a decision and maybe check back later. The Disney dreams show is one of the best shows I have ever seen. The only disappointing thing was the lack of characters walking about, and one of the rides was closed. We are currently saving our pennies for a return trip!",Disneyland_Paris

We arrived early in the day and had a great morning going on rides, seeing Cinderella, Anna and Elsa and Snow White. We then decided to stop for lunch in tomorrow land. As the food in these parks are generally similar we figured anywhere we went the food would be OK. We were not expecting a wonderful meal, however we did expect to find edible food. We ordered 2 fish sandwiches, 1 fried chicken platter and one hamburger. The fish tasted terrible, the chicken was chunked meat, and the hamburger meat was unrecognizable. For almost $80.00 USD$ this meal was a total ripoff. Do yourself a favor when going to HK Disney. Bring your own food.",Disneyland_HongKong

Great for little kids too, of course, but big kids will get a kick out of this. Going back in April 2016 as there are new exhibits and would like to see the ones I didn't get to see last time.

176365018,4,2013-08-01,United States,"This was our first time out to California, even the West Coast, and our expectations were SUPER HIGH for Disneyland, seeing that we are from Connecticut, we've always been to Disney World and have been treated well...I think I'll list the MANY things I experienced and seen.First off, WDW does such a fantastic job keeping the magic alive ALL THE TIME, because you are constantly submerged in everything Walt Disney. In Anaheim, Disneyland does not have that extra level so cast members can commute, so they have to enter and exit the same way guests do. Instantly, the magic left me when I saw cast members from Cars Land leave work, or see a member of Sleeping Beauty's Royal Gaurd enter Tomorrow Land...I think the entire bit of the magic comes from the imagination that those cast members, LIVE there, and that them working there ISN'T a job like we have. Isn't that Disney's idea to begin with? Keeping the magic alive?Although this wasn't the BIGGEST issue. I can understand that Annual Passholders have even HIGHER expectations because they are constantly there and would hate to see the same thing twice. I'm pretty sure we are all like that. This visit was made to be special for me, and I felt that all the cast members had a on off switch as far as how much their emotions can take. It was either, they were VERY NICE and were BEAMING with magic (really enjoying their jobs), or moody and pushy, especially if security needed you to BE somewhere. I used to work in a theme park, and I can feel the negative energy from guests if their days don't go right, and we are in the world that EVERYONE wants something for free, but this IS the place to go to lose yourself from YOUR JOB...such as the nature of the themepark. To escape from our real world.The overal visit was amazing. I ran through the parks during the 2013 10K and 1 2 Marathon weekend and the experience was one for the books...but as far as the crowded streets, the long lines (usual), shotty service (not fulfilling Disney standards for keeping character and politeness), these things need to be fixed. The rides themselves were memorable, the food was amazing and the feel overall was very Charming. I traveled with my parents, my father and mother, who is handicapped, they treated us with respect and quick service, only one incident REALLY took the cake, it was resolved within time.Would I visit again? Maybe. Would I bring friends instead? Absolutely. I would also plan for more than one day per park.",Disneyland_California

407533482,3,2015-12-01,United States,"I visited the week of Christmas and the lines were ridiculously long and there were many rides that were closed. We did get to ride some of the smaller ones and those were fun. Prepare to do a lot of walking... a lot. The castle itself is nicer than the one in Orlando imho because you can actually enter this castle and walk around it. I thought that aspect was pretty neat. My daughter felt like a princess roaming around the castle. The Princess show performed in front of the castle was fun to watch and it was sung in different languages. Many people there speak English so that wasn't a problem. I will say though that the line to enter the park was chaotic and completely unorganized. As a matter of fact, there was no line, just hundreds of people pushing each other to try to get through the gate. Other than that, the park itself is beautiful and with some organization and actual open rides, it can be a really fun place.",Disneyland_Paris

248496468,5,2015-01-01,Australia,Two adults and two children aged 9 and 12 visited Disneyland Anaheim for New Years eve and for an additional 5 days. This is my 4th time to Disneyland ( 2 at Anaheim and 2 in other Disneyland`s around the world ). I would still regard Disneyland as the best them park in the world. The staff are fabulous and well trained. They are always smiling and ensuring all people are happy. The attention to detail in all aspects of the park is amazing. If you can stay at the Disneyland Hotel that is attached to the Park I would recommend this. You can gain entry into the park one hour before others and obviously being attached to the park you do not have to walk as far. I would recommend the Fast Pass especially if travelling at a busy time as we did.,Disneyland_California

I was lucky to visit for a long weekend for my birthday and also lucky that I got to experience Disney and Marvel (my fav things)The park is absolutely beautiful and breathtaking from the minute you arrive.The staff are super friendly and keep the whole park spotless.The rides :So my favourite ride has to be the pirates of the Caribbean, we went on so many times! It was great fun, well thought out and so much to look at. Loved the fact there was a restaurant in there which you went passed in the boat. It really has been cleverly made.We also went on the space mountain one but unfortunately this wasn   t for me, my head banged the whole time and it was comfortable, this caused the worst headache which meant an early night and a trip to the medical room for pain killers.However that was the only bad ride for me.Buzz Lightyear ride is brilliant and fun.I loved Peter Pan that was magical.Thunder mountain is another fav of mine. Long cue but worth it.There is water fountains in the cues if you need a drinks which I think we should do more in the U.K.Indiana Jones is also a fun ride.There is a massive peter pan boat which is beautiful and I also saw Peter Pan and hook.Nice little places to grab a drink and a yummy muffin.Some things are pricey    8 for a beer!Shows:Princess waltzSo nice to see the princesses and princes dance in their amazing outfits while sang by a lady and a man with the best voices.Glad the little mermaid was there but I was disappointed she wasn   t as a mermaid at any point as she   s is my fav.The paradeI think this was on at 5pm but remember to get a good sit as people start getting ready to watch it about 4pmYou sit or stand down the sides of the roads.Don   t miss it ! The floats are out of this world and the people dancing inbetween the floats are great .Now the light and fireworks show This was the highlight of the whole holiday it was magical and breathtaking!And yes I cried like a baby. Especially when the little mermaid was lit up singing.It is so beautiful and I   m glad I experienced it with my husband. I totally fell deeper in love with him.It was so romantic and I can   t wait to visit again.Amazing light and firework show , gorgeous and cleverly put together.The whole of Disneyland (both parks) are out of this world and I want to come again and again!Truly magical",Disneyland_Paris

233086900,5,2014-09-01,South Africa,"Yes, some people will not agree with me! Yes, I am sure that some people think that some of the other Disney parks are better and brighter and bigger! We (myself, my wife and our 9 year old son) enjoyed it tremendously. It was our first visit to any park this big and it was absolutely amazing. We had tickets for four days and we spent most of all four days between the Disney park and the Walt Disney Studio Park next door. We had an absolute blast and I will recommend this to anyone who wants to have fun.I have read some of the other reviews and we must have visited a different place than what I read about. I must admit however that as an example I do not give a hoot for Halloween decorations so however much there was I couldn't care less! Yes   some of the rides were not working, but we found that over the four day period of our visit 90% of the rides were working and available.I must concur that the food and drinks are very expensive, but we are from South Africa where such things are relatively cheap when compared to the rest of the World. The fact that it is expensive is however not different to the rest of Paris. We made a plan however and packed our own lunches! This meant that we had almost total control over the expense and also about what we wanted to eat.We surely didn't find many rude people. One or two at the most, but these you will find anywhere in the World. I think that the attitude with which one approaches a visit to a place like this determines the level of joy that one actually derives from such a visit.",Disneyland_Paris

I knew it would be very similar to Disney World's Magic Kingdom yet it has a vibe all it's own with some rides the same, some rides better and some rides you can only find at Disneyland. The only two negatives are the current FastPass MaxPass is lacking compared to Disney World's Magic Band system and I found that the cast members were apathetic at best and surly at worst.

352092295,3,2016-02-01,United Kingdom,"We recently visited California and we spent a day in Disneyland. We enjoyed it, like we always do, but, whilst joining yet another seemingly endless queue (or line), it occurred to me that the original idea behind the park was to entertain and amuse children and their families; nowadays however it seems as if you spend most of the day standing in line for a ride and not actually on the ride itself. The rest of the time is spent in one of the far too many shops or restaurants selling the same type of memorabilia or pretty awful food. Obviously the shops bring in more money but surely that was not the original idea behind the creation of the amusement park? If there were more rides instead of shops the lines would be shorter and the fun greater. After all you pay enough for the entrance! Having said that, I'm sure we'll go back.",Disneyland_California

The fast track system is good to use. The staff were very kind and thoughtful, the system in place to ensure a smooth ride was really outstanding. At each ride we were asked how many and they accommodated this fact in all rides. We knew that thunder mountain would be closed, this was explained at the time of booking. However, not the carousel and another ride which was closed were we not informed about. But luckily the carousel ride did open before we left. A couple of rides had technical difficulties while we were there but again.....it happens.

536547430,4,2017-10-01,United Kingdom,"We visited Euro Disney with our 7 year old son as part of a big family holiday, staying for 3 nights at the Santa Fe hotel, with the Plus half board option.Each morning breakfast consisted of a basic continental buffet, followed by a pleasant 20 minute walk to the park entrance. The queues to get into the park appeared quite large, but were processed very efficiently. Once inside you initially walk passed rows and rows of shops and food outlets before getting to the attractions.Euro Disney is split into 2 large parks   each takes about 1 day to get around. Both parks are very well landscaped, spotlessly clean and full of friendly, well trained staff. There is a wide range of rides with something for everyone, and our son (1.2m) was allowed to go on everything except Indian Jones rollercoaster. He particularly enjoyed going on the thrill rides that he would be too short for in UK theme parks.Whilst most of the rides can be found in UK theme parks, where Disney excels is in the presentation   the attention to detail takes everything to another level. Average queue time was around 30 40 minutes, average ride time was around 1 minute. Our son has special needs and we obtained a special queue pass for him and 4 companions. On some of the rides (such as Thunder Mountain) the special needs queue was well organised and worked well, whilst on others (such as Tower of Terror) it was badly organised and took longer than the normal queue.There is a wide selection of food available within the park   all extortionately expensive. Restaurant food started at around   25 person and is very good, snack food (i.e. burgers & fries) cost around   10 person and is not that good. Every opportunity is taken to sell merchandise   again at inflated prices.One of the highlights was the closing firework & lightshow at Cinderella's Castle   fantastic display, but would be better if it started earlier (10.00pm). It gets very crowded   get there at least 30 minutes before to find a good spot, try to stand behind some fencing to get some space in front of you.Overall, the best theme park I have ever been to, also the most ruthlessly commercial. Perhaps you can't have one without the other?",Disneyland_Paris

My baby fell asleep and I've requested if we could stay for a while after the session since any motion will wake her up & the heat outside was unbearable. The answer from the Disney staff was a flat no. So I had to leave with a tired baby in my arms & walk under the heat of the sun. I expected more compassion from Disney, being a family centered theme park.  Bland Chinese food from Maxim's (plus they charge for continents like soy sauce even if they serve dimsum)  Rude staff. I saw how a staff member was so rude to a certain race who was asking how much a drink cost. The staff got the price tag & slammed it in front of the customer.

332407430,4,2015-12-01,Australia,"There's something about a Disney Theme Park that just makes it feel so much more special than the other ones. I have to say staff at Disneyland are a lot less friendly than World. My sister and I had birthday buttons and I noted that the first 2 rides we went on and for the first hour not one cast member said happy birthday although a couple of guests did. It also did nothing in the way of a free ice cream, that usually works at world ;)I was unimpressed with a few other things as well. First ride we tried to get on was Alice in wonderland at approx 5pm when we first got to the park. 45 minute wait time on the sign, ok that seems crazy but we waited. Got about 10 groups from the front and they close the entire ride down because some old man lost the key to his motorised scooter. We had to wait for everyone already on the ride to get off and then for 4 cast members to search the entire thing for these keys. They must have checked each car about 3 times each and still nothing. So far we had waited 45 mins. Then they Announced it would be another 10 before the ride started again. 10 mins later they said there was something wrong and it would be at least another 15 so we left. Over an hour of my time wasted and not even a fast pass or anything offered. We noticed that a lot of the rides had very long lines and no cast members were fixing the ropes to make the lines flow nicely instead of guests standing out into the walkways; why have extra ropes and poles out if you're not going to use them? The price of everything is insane. I expect to pay higher prices for things but $5 for a pen? Food is also not very affordable so we kept leaving and eating at downtown, at least you get a solid meal there. Rides are fun though. Loved Indiana jones the best. Hate the new theming of space mountain, I'm not into Star Wars. Really enjoyed pirates of the Caribbean as well because it's very different to worlds! Same with big thunder. Matterhorn was painful to ride, it's so old now. Went crazy over the haunted mansion and jungle cruise being all decorated for Christmas, that was super fun and gives you something completely different. Went on haunted mansion 4 times because I love nightmare before Christmas Christmas parade and fireworks were really good.

Everything here is nostalgic and simple. It's still magical, just not as  in your face  magical as WDW.The layout is perfect. Walt really knew what he was doing with the wheel and spoke design! Where as at WDW you could get lost just by turning 90 degrees, at DL if you want to see another land or world area, you just backtrack to the center by the castle, point yourself in the direction you want to go, and march towards it! There's less feelings of being lost, and less need for a map! Characters are much harder to find however. In the one day we spent there, we saw Aladdin and Genie, and maybe one of two Mickeys. No princesses or other characters. That was fine for us, but if you're in it for the character interactions, it'll be a good deal tougher here. The Space Mountain ride at DL is SO MUCH gentler than the the one in WDW. This was an enjoyable ride while the other, in it's bobsled type seats, was jarring and rough. Here you sit 2 3 to a row and go from there. It doesn't sound like it makes a difference, but it does! It also has this retro Sci Fi soundtrack that is nice and cheesy! Again, everything here is simpler and more downplayed. This was the original park after all, and Disney has done a great job keeping that feel. Keep that in mind, and the magic should feel just as real as it does at WDW, only smaller and more personal.",Disneyland_California
416296248,3,2016-09-01,Australia,"Disneyland put pure and simply is for kids. If you are looking for rides to keep you entertained I would recommend going somewhere else.This was my first time to Disney and most likely my last. At close to $100USD to enter the park I had hoped there would be more rides for my personal enjoyment, but alas the only thing to really garner my attention was the Star Wars exhibit which has a short video along with several cases of costumes and model ships from the movies as well as the opportunity to meet a couple of the characters for photo ops.Lets be honest, Disney is about taking your money. Everything here is overpriced, from bottles of Coke priced at $3.50 USD to badges starting at $9 USD ,you are being gouged for something with Mouse ears on it. But you should know that before walking in the gate anyway.I weny with my wife and friend and they had a ball. They like easy going rides so they found it enjoyable whereas I found it quite lame. But again as I stated before, the park is aimed at kids. If you are doing the rides, I recommend using their Fast Pass facility, you run to the ride, grab a ticket and come back usually in an hour or 2 and jump into a far smaller queue. Not all rides have this option, but usually the bigger, more popular rides do. Oh, and do the Indiana Jones ride asap as it quite often breaks down from what I was told. So in review, if you are a thrill seeker, go somewhere else. Expect to spend on entry and food alone nearly $200 USD per person plus souvenirs, so load up on cash. Oh, but dont worry, Disney now have a credit card that they will try to flog to you all throughout the park.",Disneyland_California

The park needs to be friendlier and I don't think the locals can do that, time for Disney to look outside of HK to hire friendlier cast members!

There are lots of sites giving tips, but the following is worth rememberingGet breakfast early and get in park, if you want a lie in, start with Studio park, opens later at 10.Crushes coaster not fastpass, be at the fate and run like hell.Plan the day, but remember to be flexible around the fastpass.Remember rides get quiet around the times of parades.Get dinner at hotel, food is good, book before you leave for the park.HAVE FUN",Disneyland_Paris

477244562,5,2017-04-01,United States,"We just returned from our latest trip to Hong Kong and a visit to Hong Kong Disney. It did not disappoint. It is an English speaking Disney with wide tree lined sidewalks. Crowding is not an issue as it is in the United States as there is plenty of room to walk around. The park doesn't open until about 10am with some rides opening at 11am, like Small World. I recommend starting at the back of the park, then working your way to the front, since we have seen everyone else doing the opposite. Had no trouble riding everything multiple times, never needed a fast pass. The most beautiful Small World (and largest) is located here. It has a bridge and is just breath taking if you are a Small World fan. You may need a respirator when you see the size of it. Overwhelming for sure. Mystic Manor is an outstanding ride that rivals anything I have seen (technologically) at Disney World in Orlando. To get to this park, it is very easy to take the train in and out. You'll arrive at a very pretty Disney train station. There is lots of pin trading here, and Hong Kong pins are easy to get. What great souvenirs! Because this location is so close to the Big Buddha, you could do both on the same day. Go to Buddha in the morning (early) and beat the heat, then train over to Disney since they do not open until 10am. You can do this park in a day. Great for all ages.",Disneyland_HongKong
329373304,4,2015-11-01,United States,"We are lifetime Disney fanatics. Up to this quick anniversary trip, we'd focused our attention on the World and the 4 parks there. We decided to go to the original and check it out. It is too bad Walt did not have the space or the forethought on how popular this place would be 60 years later. The size we enjoy at the world is lost here and the walkways are always packed with people moving in every direction without any plan to it at all. We did receive some great advice from a cast member upon entering right at park opening to go get a fastpass to the new Hyperspace Mountain and then back over to the Holiday Haunted Mansion before the lines start. This was stellar advice. Don'   t be afraid of the long line to the Space Mountain fastpass as it moves very quickly and we were out in 5 minutes. 5 minutes in line for the Haunted Mansion which is fantastic in Christmas decor and then quickly to Pirates and Indiana Jones all briskly in the morning. Over for Hyperspace Mountain which is a GREAT improvement of the original ride. What I really was nostalgic for while visiting was the paper fastpasses. I wish the World would abandon the 60 day out planning requirement for fastpass . That removes all spontaneity when visiting. I also loved the original charms that Walt had such as horse drawn carts and buses on Main Street USA and marching bands. Those charms still exist in California. The retention of the original rides such as Mr. Toad and Snow White were great to see as well.The big miss at this park is food. My wife has a garlic allergy and we have had zero issues in the Florida parks getting accommodations even at quick service meals. After very long waits for chefs to come out, they emphatically explained in many cases that there was nothing they could do. We were shocked. We did get squeezed into the restaurant in New Orleans Square and found something there for dinner.Overall, it was great seeing the original and we pounded the park in 15 hours. Paint the Night and the new fireworks are heavenly. Standing for Fantasmic was a drag on our bodies but seeing the slightly different show was worth it in the end. We'll definitely be back with our kids so they can experience it as well.",Disneyland_California

Yes its a little expensive, but the so are the UK theme parks and when Disney does something, it does it brilliantly. You can see where your money goes here. The park stayed open until 11pm which was fantastic. We will be going back. Stayed at the Hotel Cheyenne. Also excellent.",Disneyland_Paris

280041036,4,2015-05-01,India,Nice place to take kids to get the disney experience. Space mountain is just real fun and must see. Other than that there is more retail options (shops). There are specal theme events for which you need to get those passes earlier. They do not take excpetions; so for your kids better to check out those options. Vegetarian food is available only in one of the locations; should have more veg options (suggestion).The other good thing is proximity to metro station.,Disneyland_HongKong

226632538,4,2014-08-01,United Kingdom,"its worth getting tickets for both parks, this and Walt Disney Studios. this is the older park, still has some great rides such as big thunder mountain and Space mountain. we did all of the rides (apart from Star Tours) some quite a few times! even got on the old tugboat. its a shame there is no fast pass for Crushes Coaster, as only managed to get on that one time. we took advantage of the early opening for hotel guests (8am rather than 10am) and although a lot of the park wasn't open yet we did get to go on Peter Pan's magic flight, the tea cups, Buzz Lightyear's Lazer Blast and there is nothing like Space Mountain just after 8am in the morning! if you are staying in a Disney Hotel take advantage of the half board option and book dinners in the various restaurants around the two parks: three course meals with waiter service and not a burger in sight! we went to the Silver Spur Steakhouse and Walt's American Diner, both very good. The Diner was an oasis of calm in a busy park, and then tended to seat families with young children in one part and with older children in another, which seemed to work well for everyone, it definitely beats queueing up for junk food in busy fast food palaces...the show at the end was  pure Disney magic  and the parades are worth seeing !again the park is busy in the summer, so plan your days, take raincoats!, and use the fast pass when you can!",Disneyland_Paris

262987487,5,2015-03-01,Australia,"Visited in early March with our kids and grandkids, it is not only for kids but adults can have a magic time as well. Walt Disney was truly a visionary when he created this land of fun. Again fast passes are the way to go, get there early to obtain them. I think you have to pick the time of the year to visit, avoid the peak times as it would be unbearable and the queues monumental. A must see is Fantasmic and the train ride around the park to get an overall view of the various lands. The monorail is good but over before you know it and only seeing minimal views of the park itself, more of behind the scenes views. Would we do it again, of course, I can see why the locals have annual passes.",Disneyland_California
387852014,5,2016-05-01,United States,"My sister surprised me with an annual pass 3vyears ago. I get to visit from Las Vegas frequently and we take her 3 youngest kids with us (15yr old niece and 2 11 yrs old twins nephews). We cannot get enough of Disneyland and Disney California. We're kind of obsessed with it. We all love Star Wars too so all the new SW additions are amazing. Tips for newbies:1) don't park hop in one day. It takes too long getting through the lines and crowds if you don't time it just right. We spend our time one park at a time.2) get fast passes immediately. I usually take a twin with me while my sis, niece and the other twin waits in line at another attraction. Maximize time people! As soon as you're eligible to get another FP get one! This helps cut down time waiting in line.3) do the rides in that land instead of running back and forth between Tomorrowland and critter country where the 2 lands are at opposite ends of the park.4) use the train like a subway to get from one major area to another. My husband says it's his favorite  ride  but I don't agree. It's a great way to get from one area to another.5) eat breakfast before you get there. Bring snacks and water bottles with you. Save food and beverage purchases for the special places. My favorite is the Mexican place by Thunder Mountain Railroad. The clam chowder by Pirates of the Caribbean is awesome and you must try the burgers in Tomorrowland. 6) if you're a ride lover like my sister and I, skip the shows and parades and do rides in the adjacent areas as lines are shorter. You might be able to do Haunted Mansion and Pirates a few times when Fantasmic is playing. Sooooo much fun!!7) if you're new to the park, study the map and layout ahead of time. Go to bathrooms on way to other rides.8) take lots of photos as souvenirs. Shop at close by Walmart and Target for small souvenirs near the park if you're on a budget.9) don't waste time waiting in line with characters unless you're in a big group and someone is shopping or on a potty break. You can snap their pictures while in line.10) get there early and stay late. The rides are busiest 12p 8p so morning and later at night are not as bad for lines.Enjoy!!",Disneyland_California

Only disappointment was that California adventure closes at 8pm nightly to accommodate the water color show which was a huge let down and we didn't get to ride the coasters and the Ferris wheel.

616344279,5,2018-09-01,India,"Happiest place on earth? Maybe, but also one of the most crowded and expensive places on earth too!Firstly, we visited the park with young children for one day only and that is clearly not enough. Given the long lines for rides and attractions you have to really have to plan and prioritize what you want to and can possibly do in ten to twelve hours or so. Although FASTPASS, etc., did somewhat help in cutting lines you will still not be able to do everything you may want to in a day. But we still managed to do some great rides, thrills, attractions, parades and the grand fireworks at night.After the tickets and passes, all food, snacks, drinks (including water bottles), gift shops, everything inside the park is crazy expensive. It's great that you can bring in food, snacks, non alcoholic drinks and water into the park so bring as much as you can. Water fountains are scattered throughout the park so that should not be a problem.The Disney staff we encountered were very professional and helpful. You are allowed to exit and re enter that park during the day as long you have your printed entry ticket for that day. I had lost my ticket but wanted to go out for a few minutes. I approached the staff at the exit gate who directed me to a outside ticket counter where I was quickly issued a fresh duplicate ticket after completing some formalities.A magical and thoroughly enjoyable day.",Disneyland_California

Definitely bring a jacket.Around the second week of November   slightly above room temperature (mid 20s Celsius), so summer clothes are fine.The first time we were there was on New Year's eve, 2008. The only thrill ride was Space mountain. Since this was a holiday, the lines were very long.In contrast, the second time I was there, it was a weekday   there were barely any people. We didn't have to line up very long for any of the rides, even Space Mountain. Loved the new areas, like Toy Story land, Grizzly Gulch and the Mystic Manor. One of my favorite rides was the RC Car ride in Toy Story land. We loved it so much we rode it twice! It helped that there was no line. Another ride was under construction for 2016   based on the Ironman movies, so that's something to look forward to, :DWe bought our tickets ahead of time, so we didn't have to line up for them when we got there. We got a map from the stand and plotted our route. You can start in one area and work your way around the park. We were there before opening, and we were able to ride all of the rides we wanted by 6. Make sure to watch the Lion King show! I saw it twice and it was still made me misty eyed. We also saw a Stitch encounter, and while it was targeted more to kids, it was still fun. The It's a Small World ride is also a favorite   try to see if you can catch the song sung in your language!The food is expensive, but you can expect that from any theme park. Around 7:30, make sure you're already in front of the Sleeping Beauty castle. The fireworks start at 9, but going early makes sure you've got a good viewing spot. We were one of the first ones to sit down on the ground, but the wait was worth it, trust me. The first time I went there, we didn't go until almost 9, and had to see the fireworks behind the huge speaker systems. If you have time, you don't have to rush to be the first ones out.

Fantasyland and Discovery land are all about the rides (especially for the youngsters) but Adventure land and Frontier land provide a quieter and more varied experience. Yes, Pirates of the Caribbean and Indiana Jones were excellent, but the Swiss Family Robinson tree and Riverboat Cruise were just as good. So mix it up!Highlights for us all though included: spotting characters in the park, the Princess and Pirate show, the Mickey stage show, the parade, the fireworks illuminations, meeting characters and dinner at Cafe Mickey.

I did expect queues and food on the pricey side which I don't mind paying but being blatantly ripped off is really not my thing. The queues for the rides were simply ridiculous. We waited on average 45 mins to an hour for a 3 4 minute ride. After all that nothing spectacular or mind blowing at that. Over an hour wait to have a photo with any of the characters, of which we saw 3 during the whole day (almost 12 hours) Minnie, Aladdin and the Chipmunks. Forget trying to find a Princess to have a photo with one of my nieces, although every second little girl was wearing one of their dresses from the  dress up  shop which started at    70.

The park is huge and cues are long, you can get fastpasses, but think which rides you want to experience, because you can also have only one fastpass at a time. Food was basic and expensive. Next time around I will bring sandwhiches and drinks along. There are lots of different boutiques and shops that sell everything Disney related. Part of the fun was to choose which items to buy. Again, the prices are high, but we gave our daughter a budget and she was very exited about choosing the things that she the bought.Prepare you visit so that you can stay until the final show.

158262091,2,2013-04-01,Hong Kong,"Many rides and eateries were closed, place had a run down, neglected feel. Walk ways were like ash trays, littered with cigarette butts. Very few character appearances. Sad copy of the real thing.",Disneyland_Paris
199106576,4,2014-03-01,France,"Oh, it's all TERRIBLY well done and everything. It should be: a day for a family of five costs about $450 before refreshments and souvenirs. Some of the rides are great: my particular faves (and I am 47, it should be pointed out) being the Indiana Jones thing, Splash Mountain & the Star Wars business.I think the experience was enhanced by not having to queue a great deal. This was because we were there on a day that was   apparently   not busy, though there didn't seem to be any shortage of crowds about. The longest we had to wait was 30 odd minutes and that was to take my youngest for a ride in a plastic elephant. The adverts show a child skipping down a deserted Main Street or some such hand in hand with Mickey Mouse: in reality the crowds are far too dense and passageways clogged with obese people on mobility scooters for anyone to skip anywhere at all and you have to wait for half an hour to get 15 seconds with an actress disguised rather unconvincingly as that lass from  Brave.  We demurred at this.If we'd had to wait two hours for things, this would not be a 4 5 review.My tips for surviving Disney without committing multiple infanticide:1. Do your homework. Decide which rides you really must not miss and plan your day accordingly. The Fastpass system can be your friend here (it's free, by the way), but note that for very popular rides at peak times you can wait an age for the pass machine and then still die of old age in the  fast  queue.2. The food in the park is both pricey and vile. Consider smuggling your own rations in. Bags are searched at the gate by ninjas disguised as little old ladies, but they don't actually pat you down, so secrete sandwiches about your person. Or eat an extra big breakfast and just skip lunch.3. Go on a  quiet  day. March just before Spring Break was good. People apparently spend more than one day visiting Disney. God knows how they manage it. I'd be driven to drink.Still, the children loved it, which was rather the point, and I think that if I am to have a once in a lifetime Disney experience (and believe me, it will be) I'd far rather it was at the original park than at one of the newer ones. There's a bit of history about the place which is quite nice.",Disneyland_California
633278031,5,2018-10-01,United States,"Only saw a small part of the park as we were rushing to the candy stations during one of their Halloween weekends. It truly is a magical place. So decorated, so pretty, so busy. The lines are long for some rides. Sometimes you can get a picture with a princess. If you stay long enough, you can watch a parade and then the fantastic fireworks display over Cinderella castle. Bring good walking shoes, sunscreen, water, money, and maybe a sweater for the cooler evenings.",Disneyland_California
627414383,1,2018-10-01,France,It's really expensive. All the decent rides had over an hour queue. To see the princesses was over 2 hours. Most of the rides you could go on at your local fair. 20 min queue to get a hot chocolate. It's not fair on the kids. Don't sell as many tickets rather than have them queue for so long for each ride. Its unfair. You can buy a  fast past  which gives you access to three rides (one ride on each) for    45 per person on top of your ticket entry price. So for a family of 4 it's    60 per ride on top of entry ticket....I wish I was allowed to swear.,Disneyland_Paris

They recovered from the typhoon rather quickly. Most everything was open and you would never know the typhoon passed through here. The Ironman Experience is cheesy. It was just a photo opportunity with person in Ironman costume who used pre recorded voice. The Moana: A Homecoming Celebration is outdoors in a half covered venue. Also cheesy, but the kids seemed to like it. The Moana character sorta looked like Moana. The ladies might want to watch the movie again to do hula correctly. It was funny to see one of the drummers with a body suit to make him look tanned with Maori tattoos.The parade had the normal characters Toy Story, Lilo & Stitch, etc. Seemed shorter than the American version.Overall, this little Disney is entertaining for the children and maybe teenagers.

Long story short, there are a lot of rides, lots of little attractions, and let's not forget: Detail, detail, detail. That's what makes Disneyland so much more magical. The shopping is great for Disney Souvenirs, and even greater shopping in Downtown Disney. The food is pretty reasonable considering it's Disneyland; However, I'd probably stay away from all of the nice restaurants there; They tend to be not so great in my opinion (With the exception of Steakhouse 51, I believe it's called?)

I go with family for picnics, enjoy the hotel laze around the lobby and use their facilities for free and have a Mickey signature ice cream which will make your day and then head for Inspiration Lake. Children can hire a bike or a boat to ride around the lake, there is a 7 11 there serving snacks and drinks so you can travel light and enjoy many things for free.

I was able to take picture with him and he's soooo adorable!!!There were wifi's on some common areas at the park such as souvenir shops and the Main Street.

There is a wine bar to chill at while she is napping. Plus there is no way she could make it all day running around. We also stay about a mile away so it is needed for the walk to and from.

I enjoyed watching the kids faces light up when they'd see their favorite characters come out and play for a while. Depending on the time of day you go, the lines can get quite long.

The first day we spoke to the concierge to book restaurant for the next four evenings to be told that there were no vacancies at all! Surely that can not be true so we called in at various places in person   Non! No vacancy without reservation! That just left us with the lesser restaurant that did not take reservations (with an hour queue) or the hotel buffet   the food is OK but not the experience we were expecting. Do your homework beforehand and book as much as you can   everyone else does and you can always cancel when you get there.

Having park hopper is nice between these two parks as they are so close together. A few rides went down a couple times but never for long.

We were told the usual entrance that handicapped people use was broken and we had to walk around thousands of people to gain our early access rights. Not 20 minutes later, these same  broken  gates were opened to let day tickets holders in. We have been season tickets holders for years and have never been treated so rudely and without care to physical challenges. There are many wonderful people who do work at Disney, especially the people tasked with getting us on the rides, but management is still very Parisienne in it's attitudes as to how to help people. The attitude we constantly hear from these people is that if you don't like it, don't come here. Not the attitude for the happiest place on Earth. Four hour waits for rides were happening in a very overcrowded park. If I had paid EUR 90 to get in and waited that long... We have come to Disney at other time when the capacity had been reached and could not get in, even as annual pass holders. This should have been done this Halloween weekend, too.

538740219,5,2017-09-01,India,"We were allotted just a day for Disneyland, located on Lantau Island, in our package tour, and I knew it would not be enough from experience. ( I had been to Disneyworld in Florida and in three full consecutive days I had not been able to see all of it. ) We were awestruck by the beauty, the colourful displays and the cleanliness when we entered the Magical Fantasy Land ! We tried to work out a schedule according to the times and places where shows would be held, as detailed in the free brochure, but soon had to give it up since running from one location to another to keep up with the timings in the vast place was well nigh impossible. Trying another more practical approach, we started exploring with the help of a guide map also provided free. Still, in each attraction we could see only one or two parts before moving on, lest we miss out on many more.Being Sunday, there was a special parade from 3 to 4 and again from 7 to 8 p.m. We could enjoy a boat ride through a  jungle  with mechanised, very realistic animals, had lunch at The Explorer's Club ( there were country   region wise food areas,which sold mostly fast food and also some ethnic dishes ), saw many fairy characters and read a few pages of stories from books displayed on pedestals. We could visit or see stalls of Spider Man, Iron Man and Merman, had a tram ride and also saw The Toy Story. In the evening we enjoyed a song and dance programme in the auditorium before returning to Main Street to watch the display of fireworks at the end of the day. The entrance ticket included all rides and attractions and we did not have to pay anything more except for food and drink and souvenirs of which there was a plethora to choose from at various sales points. Some staff members gave away stickers with pictures of characters and attractions..We boarded our coach to return to the hotel, thrilled, tired, but yearning for more. SPECIAL MENTION : It had become very hot during the day. One of our group members was on a wheel chair and one of the rubber tyres became loose due to the heat. We tried to fix it back, but in vain. We were so grateful to a strong well built Philipino gentleman who helped us get back on track.At the auditorium, the differently abled person was given priority and accommodated in a vantage position along with her escort.RECOMMENDATIONS : 1. Plan for at least two full days to spend at Disneyland to be able to enjoy yourselves at leisure   more if you have young children, who would enjoy rides of which there are many. You have to queue up in many places for which some time should be allowed.2. Carry your own drinking water   it is exorbitantly priced inside !",Disneyland_HongKong

511441961,4,2017-08-01,United Kingdom,"Tips  Plan in advance what you intend to cover. Use the Disney website to choose carefully, what you intend to cover. Every ride on the Disney website has the timings, description, target audience and warnings if any, particularly for pregnancy, those with heart ailments, neck and back problems. Queues are long, for many rides. Plan well. Read the descriptions. Read height requirements.Use the online maps. Mark which rides have FastPass  Arrive early, leave late. Fireworks are post sunset, timings vary based on season  Fastpasses are free; But you can't hold more than two and the second has riders. Early morning on entry, collect a fastpass for a popular ride which you wish to definitely go onto. Collect a fastpass by scanning your tickets at the kiosk close to the ride, every ride suggests a wait time and the popular ones have a fastpass kiosk which suggests the time to come back after collecting the pass. The pass once collected, allows you to enter the ride through a short queue, which you need to enter within a span of time printed on the pass.   Food is Expensive here. Carry what you can.   Water and drinks are Expensive. Carry empty bottles. There are plenty of water fountains  If buying ice cream, remember that it is not allowed once you reach a ride. Oops, they made my son throw his,even in the gentlest of rides.  Plan a popular ride during the parade or just before the fireworks start, the ride would be less crowded then  Some attractions and rides close earlier, example the park train which circumvents the parkFrom amongst the rides we coveredBest rides in Paris for adults   Autopia, Big Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones    and the Temple of Peril,For All   'it's a small world' (we did this Twice), NEW Star Tours: The Adventures Continue, Autopia, Big Thunder Mountain, Peter Pan's Flight Also good   Casey Jr.     le Petit Train du Cirque, Okay   Les Voyages de Pinocchio, Dumbo Flying Elephant, the Carousel, Tea Cups, Disney Parade, Sleeping Beauty Castle, Le Pays des Contes de F  es",Disneyland_Paris
630458206,5,2018-11-01,United Kingdom,"This was our first experience of Disney and we absolutely loved it. Although We originally thought it would be more character based and less theme park we actually really loved the theme parks in particular Peter Pan ride, Buzz laser blast and Star Tours and Ratatouille.We thoroughly enjoyed the parades and especially the loved the illuminations which were magical for our young children and what we imagined Disney to be about.Two minor things, the constant queuing gets tiring as with any theme park so if you can afford to upgrade to fast pass it   s worth it. Also some of the staff in the shops were rude which was not quite the Disney experience we expected however don   t let that detract from going but it   s good to be prepared for it so it doesn   t upset your trip.",Disneyland_Paris

I have visited this park over 30 times, over a 20 year time span and every time is different. There is lots of walking so put on comfy shoes and go! I really don't think there is a bad ride. There is a ride for every one of all ages to endure. I like the fact that there are Fast Pass tickets to use if the lines are outrageously long. These aren't offered on all rides, but the more popular ones. We always take a backpack with snack bars and bottled water to carry us thru the day, but hey...what is Disneyland without sampling their delicious foods and baked goods! Save your money and go for a 2 3 day hopper pass. The more days one stays, the cheaper the ticket per day cost is.

Being a non white my children were disappointed on a number of occasions even when they were among first ones to approach a character. Even the staff escorting these characters get the white children to the characters despite they saw our children being there for long time..

Characters did wonderful interactions as always and some nice new souvenirs were available in the shops. Halloween decorations were being put up.

It is actually Disneyland :) ...Jokes apart... Visited for the Full day and we enjoyed a lot. If you have kids than it is a must visit place.

298786460,5,2015-07-01,Canada,"Full disclosure: I am a Disneyland fan. Love, love, love Disneyland.My son is now 10.5 years old. When he was a baby I promised to bring him to Disneyland often.But secretly I just love it here!!!It's just such a welcome escape from The Real World and the stresses that accompany it.My son's first trip was when he was just under a year old. The best part of that trip was taking the photos of my wee one with the Disney costume characters.My son really liked Minnie Mouse when he was a babe.As he became older his favorite characters became Mickey Mouse and the chipmunks Chip and Dale.Back then he was willing to stand in line and patiently wait for autographs and photos. This trip, however, we were not able to take photos with the Disney characters in their special 60th Anniversary blue costumes. The lines were just too long. This was the only disappointing aspect of the trip.This summer I decided to fly to SoCal as I wanted to visit Disneyland for its 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration.I watched the 3 new shows on YouTube before I flew down here as I wanted to see what the hype was all about. There's good reason for the hype!The new Paint the Night Parade was so much fun to watch! I watched it twice during our 5 day visit. The music still lingers in our heads. Can't wait until our next visit!The new Fireworks show is also very cool! I watched it twice.I really enjoyed watching the show from different locations in the Park. From Main Street the projections on the buildings are very cool.From the Castle the projections are fabulous! Watch for Nemo  swimming !We also watched the Fourth of July fireworks. Crowds on July 4 are much like the Christmas crowds. Yikes! Just keep swimming!!!Visiting Disneyland and creating wonderful memories to treasure are why we keep returning to Disneyland.Hopefully the new Star Wars park will come to fruition. We asked Disney cast members about the SW park and they happily shared the rumours...Tips:1. A park hopper is definitely the way to go. 2. Stay hydrated and drink lots of fluids   water is best. Try not to drink too much Coke. Even though Coke is my preferred beverage it's very bad and will dehydrate you very quickly!If you need First Aid, the nurses and paramedics are top notch.3. Lines are very, very long. Using FastPasses are a must. 4. Get there early. At opening time. Otherwise the lines are unbearably long. Very hard on wee ones.5. There are peaceful spots in the Park to escape the masses. Seek and ye shall find.6. Be prepared to  camp out  if you want an excellent viewing spot for the Paint the Night Parade and Fireworks show.7. Turkey legs. Yum!8.

448710425,4,2016-12-01,Canada,You cannot have a bad time at Disneyland! The park was decorated beautifully with all the lovely Christmas decor. During Christmas they have fireworks every night and several parades during the day. Always something exciting going on. And the Disney staff do all they can to ensure order during the busy Christmas season. Politely asking people to move along if they have stopped in a through walk way etc. The food and drink are ridiculously over priced but everybody knows that so it should not shock you. My only complaint are the strollers. Oh my goodness the strollers!! I don't understand why people think it's a good idea to push a stroller around that is the size of a small car? Or why they feel the need to stop abruptly in the middle of a walkway. They are a hazard in my opinion. I would like to see double strollers banned from Disneyland during peak times. Disneyland is a magical place though and Disneyland at Christmas does not disappoint!,Disneyland_California

Prices are extremely high in the food courts and some of the attractions were closed. This should have resulted in a reduction on entry fees. We went to Disney Studio first and was disappointed that on a walk around the park there was no characters around. In Orlando you are falling over them. We went to the main park around 1500 and caught a part of the parade. It again was only on the parade we saw any characters. We went to the Meet Mickey House at 17.30 and it was closed for the day. It had been open but closed before 17.30 so if you go then visit this park first. I always enjoyed my visits to Orlando and LA Disney but this is a poor version of the product.,Disneyland_Paris

244495045,1,2014-12-01,United Kingdom,"This place is in what appears to be a terminal decline.Crush, Aerosmith, Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones, Peter Pan, Pinnocchio, Flying Carpets, Carousel, Dumbo......a list of great rides?....er...no.That is a list of rides that broke down not just while we were there but while we were actually queuing to get on them!The staff at DIsneyland Paris quite simply could not care less.My guess would be that their productivity levels are less than 10 percent.As a result the customer experience is utterly woeful.Don't expect to be told that the rides are broken. You have to work it out yourself. The staff simply don't care enough to tell you.Do expect to be denied access to most of the park until 10:00. Don't expect all of the rides to have been tested and ready to run at 10:00 though. Oh no. You have to queue while that is done.If you have extended access then you can get into a small proportion of the park at 8:00 where you will find that the rides have already started to break down!The loudspeaker announcements still oversell the experience massively but in fairness unlike Florida where you will be wished a fantastic time or the best experience or a great day; in Paris they offer you a pleasant day.Of course you won't have a pleasant day because customer service vanished at this attraction just as if it was the victim of a witches spell.My simple message to anyone thinking of visiting this decaying attraction is simple. Don't.My message to Disney is that this attraction is seriously damaging your brand.It needs a turn around specialist to either motivate or dismiss and replace the existing staff.With the right leadership, some investment and a free rein to performance manage the staff this place could be rescued. In fact it would be a good managerial challenge.For the time being though if you want some Disney go to Florida.

312448582,5,2015-09-01,United Kingdom,"We visited the Disneyland Paris Park as part of our honeymoon   I had fond memories of visiting Walt Disney World in Florida when younger, and less fond memories of a very wet out of season visit to this particular park in the mid 90s as part of a school trip. Happily, we loved the park   my wife is a big Disney fan and collector who had never visited any of the parks before, and loved it, and even I (not generally a big theme park fan) had a fantastic time. Despite the fact that the weather was extremely variable (ranging from torrential downpours to mini heatwaves across the days we were there), it was still a great experience. Going mid week in September was a definite advantage, as the park was quieter and even though there were still queues for many rides, these were generally at tolerable lengths. We noticed a marked difference on our last day, Saturday, when the park got very busy and queues for attractions were considerably longer.The daily shows were well worth catching   it was nice to see Magic On Parade, featuring the various Disney characters, in the late afternoon   early evening, but the real highlight was the stunning Disney Dreams sound and light show (with fireworks and other practical effects), which was definitely one of the highlights of our visit. I notice some reviews criticise the lack of characters walking round   given how Mickey was practically mobbed one evening in Main Street after the fireworks, we thought the system of organised meet and greet sessions worked very well (we were in the park early each morning, circa 8am, to make the most of our 'Extra Magic Hours' as Disney hotel guests, and Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Goofy   Pluto were all present, with others popping up throughout the day), although it might have helped for these appearances to be more formalised and advertised, which as far as we're aware they weren't.'Buzz Lightyear's Laser Blast', 'Pirates of the Caribbean' and 'Space Mountain' were among the ride highlights, though we also really enjoyed more sedate offerings like the 'Thunder Mesa Riverboat Landing'. Sometimes it's nice to take things easy. It was nice to be able to ride the original 'Star Tours' (which admittedly is looking a bit old fashioned these days) before it closes to be refitted and updated in 2016. It was a bit disappointing for such a major park that several attractions would end up closing due to technical problems, sometimes a number of times each day, but on the whole the staff were quite helpful and provided information as best they could in these situations.The food offer was generally good   we ate at the Silver Spur Steakhouse and the Blue Lagoon (the latter attached to the 'Pirates' ride), both of which had a pretty good menu and attentive and friendly staff. The counter service restaurants were more of a mixed bag, although the Lion King styled Restaurant Hakuna Matata was one of the better ones. Some of the others were either unremarkable or got extremely busy   trying to get served at the likes of Cafe Hyperion in Discoveryland at peak times was a real pain, as the queues moved very slowly.Whilst we had some minor quibbles, on the whole we were very happy with our visit, and were impressed with the park, its attractions and how it was run. I'd recommend it to anyone (although personally think it might be a bit much for some very young children, who probably wouldn't get as much out of it as their parents might hope they would).",Disneyland_Paris

129965197,4,2011-08-01,Australia,"A surprise treat for the children! The children were so excited when they walked out of the station and saw the theme park. We arrived at 10am with my sister in law and her fiance. We were blessed with a warm and sunny day. I was surprised that it wasn't as crowded as I thought it would be especially when it was the summer holidays. We went through the security entrance fairly quickly, took some photos before entering the theme park through the gates where we handed in our tickets. The staff were very helpful when they saw we had baby in the stroller. We surveyed the area as we went through and than checked the maps to see what was of interest to the children. Its worth doing that so you know which direction to go and where you want to finish as it saves time and you going round in circles. The children chose their rides and the ones that had long queues we decided to visit last. Having spare adults certainly helps if you have different age groups. My sister in law and fiance took my 3 older ones and I stayed with baby. My husband was to meet us later in our trip so it was just the children, myself and my sister in law, fiance who offered to help with the children in Disneyland. Baby's changing room was great but a little bit over crowded as expected. The clinic was wonderful and the staff were helpful. I needed a place to breastfeed baby and they happily gave me a seat, pulled the curtains and said if I needed anything I just had to ask. They had strollers in designated areas that were free. Grab one if you have another child under 10. Some of the rides were closed due to maintenance. Hello...it's summer and they should plan ahead so people are not disappointed. One of the better rides was affected by...maintenance!! Anyway, we made the most of it. The kids had fun and just seeing their happy faces made it all worthwhile!!! We spent a fortune especially at the souvenir shop. We arrived at 10am and left at 10pm...very long day but worth it! We went to both theme parks. I suggest 2 days if you have little ones so you get to appreciate your time there and not get over tired and crumpy. You'll miss the point of why you're there! Fortunately, it didn't happen to me because I had help but I saw adults that went crazy.

But 5 days was still not enough for us to see everything.All the staff were friendly and helpful, bathroom facilities were numerous throughout and the Front Of Line pass system was great. My Tip: The CARS ride was the highlight for us and is the most popular ride so getting a Front of Line pass is a must but they are usually exhausted by about 10.00am so get yours early.My tip, however, is to try to visit during the week as the crowds get really big on weekends.

357345307,3,2016-03-01,Ireland,"Just returned from a four day trip. This was our second visit after a gap of seven years and we were taken aback at how much the park has aged. It is still immaculately clean and tidy , but badly needs the renovation work that is currently being undertaken. The signs of wear and tear are everywhere to be seen. Some of this could be easily disguised with a lick of paint or a good blast of a power washer. One thing that has remained unchanged is the high cost of everything in the park. I know they are catering for a captive audience but to be asked to pay 13 euro for a very average burger is just too much. A small Coke will set you back 3.49 and a bag of crisps is 2.49 . My only bit of advice for anyone travelling here is to go mid week as the queues at the weekend are over an hour for the more popular rides and to bring your own food into the park with you. The shop in the railway station sells sandwiches for 3 euro . Anyone looking to enjoy a relaxing beer will have to fork out 7.49 for the pleasure. I would strongly advise a visit to City Hall on arrival in the park , where you can book all your restaurants for your stay. If you don't book in advance , you will have great difficulty in finding places to eat as they are all very busy. We were on a meal plan option which saved us a great deal of money but I have to say the quality of food in the buffets did not justify the cost. You are charged 35 euro for canteen quality items such as beef stew , pizza slices , meatballs and some soggy vegetables . Having said all this , the kids will love it and you will find yourself humming the songs from the parades and you won't be able to stop yourself smiling when you see the characters walk around. It is still a magical place but it needs a little TLC to make it sparkle once again .",Disneyland_Paris

223849736,3,2014-08-01,Bulgaria,"We visit Disney a familiy with childern from age 6 to age 16.Maybe we had high expectations that were not fulfill, however we expected more from what consider to be the best theme park in EU.Without a doubt the atmosphere and the scenery of the park are magical, but the attraction are not to exciting, the variety for children above age 10 is poor, the queues are long and all day we did not see any Disney character amusing the childern. One can expect that in 45 minute queue or in the park the childern would meet the beloved disney characters...it seems that Disney has put most of it effort in planning the shops and restaurants rather than amusing the customers, in that sector the variety was excellent and prices were too expensive.If your children are above 10 years old I would not recommend.",Disneyland_Paris

The lines are really long averaging a one hour wait. Even though all of the amenities and service provided are top notch you will will not get to enjoy it because of the huge masses of people in the park. Visiting the park during off season is a whole different kind of story.,Disneyland_Paris
339831613,5,2015-10-01,United States,"My hubby and I took the kids to visit Disneyland during Halloween and it was great! We paid extra to go to the special Halloween celebration and it was worth it. Everyone was in costume, we all had an overload of candy and healthy goodies from trick or treating, and the atmosphere there is so positive and fun! We ate breakfast at our hotel and brought snacks and water to the park so we only had to pay for one overpriced meal a day.  It's a small world  was closed, but everything else was up and running and the kids loved all of it! My son got to meet Thor and Captain America, we didn't even know they were part of Disney. The Haunted Mansion was transformed into the Nightmare before Christmas and was great. We LOVE fast passes. If there was a line longer than 30 minutes, we'd get a fast pass or go on it the next day. No more waiting for over an hour to go on a ride. I highly recommend the  Paint the Night  Parade and the fireworks following, there are tons of lights and fun music and lots of characters for everyone in the parade. Make sure you get a seat at least 30 minutes before the parade. For our family with a 4, 8 and 11 year old, we enjoyed more at Disneyland than at CA Adventure.",Disneyland_California
465783596,5,2017-03-01,Canada,"This is our 3rd time returning with our kids (6 and 4), and 4th for me and my husband. We love Disneyland and all the fun it has to offer. The rides are awesome and we are never disappointed with any of the shows, character meets and parades. The Electric Parade was great and a perfect end to one of our days. We liked it had 2 parade times and were able to catch the earlier 6:45 time with our young, tired kids. The park is super clean and all the staff helpful and friendly. We always set out for certain treats during our visit (not all at once!)   this time was cookies from the Winnie the Pooh gift shop, Dole Whips from the Tiki Juice Bar, the turkey leg from Edelweiss Snacks (2 adults shared 1 and it was plenty!), and popcorn. And for me, Starbucks at the Market House. We had a 5 day Park Hopper and by the end, we had done all that we had wanted, plus some. It rained on our first day but that didn't stop us. Soaked and chilled, we kept on and found the ride lines were non existent. If you are prepared, don't let the rain keep you away! Make sure to use FastPass, Single Rider passes and Rider switch where available to cut back on your line wait times. A couple of our favourite rides were closed for refurbishment this time (Matterhorn and Pirates) but understand this needs to happen, even if it is a tiny bit disappointing for a split second ... until something else shiny catches our attention and we quickly forget! Our trip was awesome, but like any Disney vacation, the crowds and lines can be tiring by the end and we had enough.

134069958,5,2012-07-01,Australia,"We lived our lifelong dream of going to Disneyland whilst holidaying in the US. How could you go to the US and not go to Disneyland? Honestly, the place is amazing, it is so well done and maintained but not as big as what I thought it would be! We got there as soon as the park opened to avoid queue's, I strongly advise doing this, especially if you have little ones and to get on the popular rides first. The ticket we purchased also gave us access to California Adventure Park next door. We took advantage of the Fast Pass  Basically get one of these and it reserves your spot in the line so you can go explore elsewhere and come back at the specified time and you won't have to wait to get on the rides. The Fast Pass wait does go up as the day goes on thou! A highlight for me was Space Mountain, it is a bit tame these days but a must after hearing about it for soooooo many years. The food is also sensational, go to the chocolate shop and indulge  it is the best of the best! Toon Town is also fun, I loved going into Minnie's house! To be honest, we did get over Disneyland in about 3 4 hours, we found a few of the big rides, Mattahorn and Indiana Jones were unfortunalety 'Not in Service'. However, I can only imagine how amazing this place would be for kids and if I ever have kids, I will be taking them here because I know how much they would love this experience and remember it forever! It must be hard for parents thou, waiting in those lines, having to buy all those souveniers and all that food...",Disneyland_California
585622171,2,2018-06-01,United Kingdom,"All in all, the park and studios are good fun if you and your kids don   t mind the constant walking and queuing. Positives: some really good rides and shows (when they   re not being cancelled), including the end of day illuminations. See below for my faves.Negatives: the drinking fountains aren   t shown on the app, most food choices from the various stalls a fast food style rubbish, you can   t get a decent coffee anywhere (McDonalds was the best    I can   t believe I just wrote that but it   s true); Magic Time (for Disney Hotel guests) is helpful but not all rides are available at that time. And, as you might expect, everything is massively overpriced. Feel that Disney Magic in your wallet!Really negatives: disgusting blocked toilets in more than one location; very poor experience with the Disney hotel (Cheyenne) which put a downer on the holiday.HINTS: the app, while being very far from perfect, is worthwhile having as the queue times are broadly correct (most of the time) and use the Fast Pass system to help skip past the worst of the queues.Best rides for adults and older kids: Tower of terror (scary!), hyperspace mountain, rock and roller coaster and big thunder mountain.Best riders for younger kids (6 ish in our cases, although we all enjoyed these): Ratatouille, Star Wars Tour, the Circus train thing at the top of the park, it   s a small world, Pirates of the CaribbeanBest shows: Mickey and the Magician, end of day illuminations, Moteurs Action and the Studio Tram tour. Pirates and Princesses parade was pretty good too, wasn   t impressed by the Pirate show.",Disneyland_Paris
395298046,5,2016-03-01,Philippines,"Being an amusement park aficionado, I was prepared to discount HK Disneyland as one of the more mediocre and smallish theme parks compared to others across the globe. However, I was pleasantly surprised and enthralled at the unique attractions offered! There are several spots that are beautifully distinctive of their Chinese heritage. The Explorer's Club Restaurant, for instance, looked like a dream and it felt like I was transported back to imperial China while I was eating there. Plus, they offered Hainan chicken which is my favorite! The newly installed Toy Story Land is fantastic, designed to make you feel like one of the toys in the movie, with the huge dominos, bulb lights, and toy crates. The rides here are worth noting as well for their thrill factor.My favorite attraction apart from Space Mountain has to be the Mystic Manor! I won't spoil the surprise, but it is definitely a must ride twice, as it offers a different experience every time!I have to comment as well on the absolutely 100% magical fireworks show at the end of the day, which almost brought me to tears. DON'T SKIP THIS! It is by far the best and most enchanting among the other fireworks display I've seen in all Disney parks (Disneyworld Florida included!), as it features one of a kind pyrotechnics coupled with projected animation on the Cinderella castle, lots of flame effects, all beautifully synchronized to Disney music.",Disneyland_HongKong
143560599,5,2012-09-01,United States,"I had not been to Disneyland for over 18 years and didn't give it too much thought since we used to go alot when we lived in California when I was younger. However, bringing my own kids was a whole new experience, and a worthwhile one. We came here off season during the week and were able to get early admission into the park since we stayed at a Disney Hotel. We went on alot more rides than I thought we would be able to go on and my husband and I could each fit two kids with us, since they are small. A couple of the rides were a little scary even though they were supposed to be for little kids though. My toddler got freaked out in the Nemo submarine and Mr. Toad's ride so keep that in mind if you have a more sensitive child. Also, the one ride I was going to go on by myself was closed for refurbishing so that is good to check online before you go there if you had your heart set on something. My husband and I made use of the parent swap pass on a couple of rides which worked out well. We had one umbrella stroller for our toddler but were going to get a stroller for our 4 year old twins since there was so much walking. We were already in the park when we were told that the stroller rental was outside the main entrance. It wasn't super obvious. We didn't get one since they don't rent out double strollers. Also, we were told that you could buy sunscreen everywhere, wherever you looked. We looked just about everywhere and found one gift shop that had it. Was really strange since it was so hot there. We couldn't bring alot on the plane so decided to buy it when we got there. All of us are very fair skinned so sunscreen was a must! Wearing hats kept us alot cooler as well. The temperature was in the 90s. All in all, we had a great time and never had to wait too long in a line even though it seemed like alot of people were there. I definitely think going off season during the week is your best bet if you are able to and staying at one of the Disney Hotels so you are close to the park and can get early admittance. Lots of fun!",Disneyland_California

Entrance to just one parc for 2 adults and an 8 year old was 211 euros. On the internet it said that one child goes free with one full adult price. Of course this turned out to be only on the internet and of course when you are travelling and staying in a hotel, it is so easy to print out such a ticket! One third of the rides was closed. Most rides took 50 minutes queueing for a non descript experience of 90 to 120 seconds. A small bottle of Perrier cost 3.95 and there was no candy floss and nowhere to even have a beer. Went into the steak house to try and find solace with a good piece of meat and a glass of wine and that was closed! The rest of the food seemed to be only lousy American junk food! What a rip off, what a come down for the kids. I would not go there again even if they paid me 1000 euros! But yet they were selling annual season tickets which apparently were  rentabilise  or became worth it after the second time! Christ, they have to be kidding! Who would ever want to go back there after the first time? It is more like a punishment, like going to prison. The only thing going for the parc is a few Disney characters, though you even have to wait for Mickey Mouse to meet him (another 50 minutes)!!!

148427394,3,2012-12-01,Belgium,"As a very frequent visitor (we must have been visiting Disneyland over 100 times by now since we have Dream passes for the past 10 12 years) we still enjoy visiting the park because of the general athmosphere. When you see the park for the first time, you will be impressed from many surprizing elements. Yet, we can only say that the exceptional nature of Disneyland is gradually disappearing. This is likely a result of the need for cost savings, made by Disney management. I the past there were great shows like  The Lion King ,  Mulan ,  Beauty and the Beast ,  Pocahontas ,...Apart from  Tarzan  which is a show that was still running last summer, all inside  shows  have been eliminated. Yet, this was probably one of the elements that could attract an audience of all ages. While today the rmaining attractions focus on small kids and on youngsters that like to sit in  fast  attractions. Also, some attractions inside (Peter Pan, Snowwhite, Pirates of the Carribean,...) are pretty dark and makes you miss the fine details which you could see in the first years of the park. Maybe this is done to limit the frightening effect for small children, but again this makes the park more and more and attraction for smaller children rather than for adults.Petty, but we still hope the great shows will come back one day.",Disneyland_Paris

The staff are always really helpful   when my sons autograph book got lost in the restaurant they directed us to customer services who replaced it straight away   and the attention to detail around the park is really fantastic.

375736836,5,2016-05-01,United Kingdom,"For my 3 year old daughters birthday, me and my wife decided to treat her to a weekend at Euro Disney.Me and my wife have visited the park a few times over the years but this was our first time to try out both parks over 2 days.We planned it out that on the Saturday that we would do Dinseyland alone and then on the Sunday Disneystudio, with the option of Disneyland added in that afternoon should we run out of things to do.On the Saturday the weather was fantastic and as a result the rides were all busy (even simple rides like Dumbo's Flying Circus Ride were 20 minutes in line for by lunch time) but if you plan it out right you can avoid hours and hours lost waiting in line (my daughter is a massive Toy Story fan, so we picked a good spot to watch the 5:30 parade, and after 15 minutes when it passed by we went to Buzz Lightyear Laser quest and were straight on to it).... after dinner in Futureland we just spend the last few hours on rides like Pirates of the Caribbean before heading home.There does seem to be a lot of renovation works going on (Frontier Land and Adventure Land seemed to be completely closed apart from the Haunted House and Pirates of the Caribbean Rides) and the train that goes around the park was only stopping at one station all day.Next day we purchased the  2 parks in 1 day  pass and after being at Dinseystudies from 11am until 3pm we went across to Disneyland Park. The Sunday the weather had turned and was wet all day, but as a result we were straight on to EVERY ride and by 6pm it felt like we had the park almost all to ourselves.Certainly worth a visit and the look on my 3 year old daughters face made it worth it..... but if taking someone so young be ready for a number of fits and tantrums throughout the day (first day our daughter did not want to nap during the day and with the heat she was VERY grumpy by dinner time...but nest day she napped for about 2 hours in her buggy and for the rest of the day was as good as gold).Well worth doing if you do not fancy a transatlantic flight to the Orlando Parks, but if you get lucky with the weather you get just as great day.Food is a lot to be desired for (two days on rather poor burgers left me feeling uncomfortable.... so best to bring your own stuff as the money does seem to go in no time on small things throughout the day).",Disneyland_Paris
195779901,5,2013-12-01,United States,"Okay there are many wonderful places to visit and we travel quite a bit, but disney remains a family favorite! We visit probably 4 times a year and we always say at the end of our trip that we are going to take a break from Disney for a while, but then we go through withdrawals and have to come back. Yes the food is overpriced and there are only a few restaurants with high quality meals, but nothing beats the atmosphere. Lines are long, but if you utilize the fast pass system then you shouldn't have to wait in line for more than 30 minutes for anything, even during busy season. I think it is worth the money to spread out the trip and not try and squeeze it all into the fewest days possible. The best part of Disney is to relax, take your time, and enjoy the various shows, admire the gardens, and just people watch while eating the best corn dogs in the world (I know weird right?). Point being, if you try and rush to do DL in one or even two days, and your intent is to hit everything, you will get annoyed quickly by the crowds and leave your vacation tired.

There were some top ride where we waited max. 20 minutes, but the average was less than 10 minutes.

All attraction were well maintained and in a great shape.We also red a lot negative comments about the staff but we found them very kind, polite and all speaking English.We used the first evening after arriving to watch the night show at Disneyland Park and it was a good decision because after the full day visits we were too tired to stay for the night. The show was fantastic!Regarding catering we had breakfast at the hotel (Santa Fee, very basic breakfast), an early lunch at Plaza Gardens Restaurant (all you can eat buffet with a great selection of international courses at 27    for adults and 15    for kids, free for 0 3 y.o.) and some snacks like hot dogs for dinner at 6 7   .We preferred Disneyland Park because it's a large beautiful park with lots of flowers, trees and lakes.

597512353,3,2018-07-01,United States,"My 4 year old had fun here but the long lines were a little too much for him. There is a lot to do here. When you factor in the lines, I don   t think anyone can go through the whole park in one day. We saw maybe a third of it. We were at Disneyland for about 6 hours.The food here is highly overpriced. The shops were crowded, but nice for AC. The bathrooms were a bit dirty. The toilets are on the ground (which is good for boys).There were a lot of rude tourists (adults and kids) who appear to be in a rush and were pushing a lot.Overall, it was worth visiting once. I may or may not go back when my son is older, more patient, and can protect himself from the tourists who push. FYI: I asked them at the gate.... If I buy a one day ticket and my son loves it, could I upgrade to the two day ticket and pay the difference before I leave? The answer was no.",Disneyland_HongKong
245212543,5,2014-12-01,South Africa,It was a cold and rainy day. Despite the weather the show went on and we enjoyed it. Got the real Christmas feeling too with the lights and music. One or two of the rides were closed because of the weather. But we didn't mind for the simple fact that there were less people. Personally I dont like big crowds. The fireworks at the end of the day were spectacular. If you want rides to get the adrenaline going the Ocean Park will be better.,Disneyland_HongKong

142258591,5,2012-08-01,Australia,"I had one of the greatest days of my life at this Disneyland!! It isn't the biggest but it is BIG! and it is also the original land that Walt Disney lived at with his family :)It was awesome, i loved it!!I have to say, it is hard to say which was my favorite ride. I went with my mum, and she had just as much fun as i did so your never too old :)Also, when your in  Mickey's toon town  if you line up at Mickey's Barn, you can go line up for up to maybe 10 minutes in airconditioning and get an exclusive picture with Mickey! It was the best way to see him :) and you also get to see some cool and quirky things inside his barn too! And watch some of his original cartoons while your waiting.Toon town is just really cool in general too. You get to see all the disney character's homes! and they are usually somewhere around there (for a picture opportunity).Also if you like frozen drinks, they have 'apple' frozen drinks in Toon Town and they are so yum! never tried such a good frozen drink. Only in Toon Town though! otherwise they have it in a few other places but isnt the same syrup.Best time!!!",Disneyland_California

259151743,5,2015-02-01,Canada,"My family went to Disneyland for 3 days (Fri Sun). We stayed at the Grand Californian Hotel on the park property. You can get easy and early access to the park by doing this although it isn't cheap. If you are an earlybird (we are even with kids aged 3 and 5), you can get a lot done before the masses arrive. We were in Toontown at 9am, one of the first ones there. Goofy was standing around taking photos, Mickey and Minnie's houses had a 0   5 min wait to meet them, no wait for rides, etc. Since we always went into the parks early (Disney and California Adventure Park), we didn't need to go to the character breakfasts (expensive) because we saw every princess and character in both parks with minimal waits to take photos ... EVEN Elsa (no wait   can you believe it?) If you can go during off season, it's the best time but some rides and attractions were closed for maintenance like It's A Small World. Get a FastPass for the Fantasmic Show as soon as you enter Disneyland. It's worth getting a seat up close to the water show at night. You'll have to sit on the ground in front of the lake for about an hour to save your spot but it's worth it because the first night, we didn't and we couldn't see anything due to the crowds. Second night, we were right up front. Take some snacks and a blanket or something soft to sit on. The show is unbelievable! Plan ahead with your FastPass rides and which attractions to see first. It's better to take the time before the trip to do this or you'll be running around trying to find the shortest line up .. and there won't be one! My daughter received a birthday button from the hotel and everyone who worked at Disney said Happy Birthday to her all day long even if they were part of the parade. She even got a free dessert at a restaurant. Even as adults we were so excited to be in Disneyland. I got a silhouette framed cut out of my kids from the same lady who made mine 35 years ago!",Disneyland_California

Yes it is pricey but every cent you spend there is the best dollar you will spend for fun and family entertainment. We took our 4 grandchildren and daughter for the 6 year olds birthday. It was not our first trip to Disneyland. I can remember how many time we ( my husband and our kids) have gone. Guessing it could be 30 or more. It never gets old it is always evolving. The only part of Disneyland that needs work is Tomorrow Land but I now know it will be upgraded very soon. The best place we went was Minnie's breakfast, the characters there are so kind to the kids of all ages. My 15 year old grandson was hugged so tight from Tigger, and the Fairy Godmother granted my Daughter every wish. We are just an average family that can find joy and happiness in the Magic Kingdom. We also think Disneyland is the best of all the Disneys ever built. Fantasmic is the best show created, do not miss this show. Now go and have fun. You can not do this park justice with a 1 day pass, 3 days at the least. Have fun enjoy!",Disneyland_California

112335345,1,2011-06-01,United States,"First, let me say, I love Disneyland, BUT...we went on a Tuesday (June 7th), and the crowds were a nightmare... this is the first time I've been to Disneyland where I wanted to leave as soon as I went through the main gates... But, I forged ahead, since my son was with me and wanted to go. People were packed into the park like sardines, it was just awful. We have Socal Passports, and maybe that's part of the problem! Like others, I think there are too many local people visiting for only half the day... and it's making this a miserable place! Time to stop selling annual passes, since it's no fun to go anyways, 9 times out of 10. Please, Disneyland, do SOMETHING about overcrowding... we were there for 7 hours and we went paddling on the canoes, went on Pirates (although it did break down in the middle of the ride) ... and Autopia w Fastpasses and that's it. Everything else that I saw... easily 45 min waits, if not more. What else... we didn't want to wait 2 hours for Star Tours (Fastpass was sold out) so we missed that... Big Thunder Mt.(my fave ride)  CLOSED for the day... I did enjoy the tostada I ate for lunch though... so one highlight! Maybe this was just a peak day for crowds, although we also went in March on a Wednesday and it was almost as bad. It's really a joke going when it's this crowded. And I felt very sorry for everyone who came from out of state!",Disneyland_California
512391948,5,2016-09-01,Australia,"We visited Disneyland in Spring, staying at an onsite Disney resort. I had previously thought that Disneyland was a theme park for children, with little to offer for adults or older teens. How wrong I was! This holiday catered for all, no matter your interests or age. We stayed for 7 nights and this was not long enough to do everything that we wanted. You could certainly see both Disneyland and California Adventure Park in a couple of days, but to experience it, and discover all it has to offer needs time. Firstly, this is nothing like the parks we have in Australia. The entire place is themed, not just the rides attractions but every detail of every inch of the park. I was also surprised by how clean and well kept the entire park was. All staff were very friendly and helpful. They also seem to be able to get people onto rides at about three times the speed of our themes parks. This all adds to the magic and feeling that you are truly away from the rest of the world. Rides vary from classic Disney story telling attractions for the whole family, to the more popular thrill rides. My wife and kids loved Peter Pans Flight. I must say though, that even the faster rides are probably not as full on adrenalin spiking as those at other theme parks. So if thrill rides are your sole reason for going, you may be a little disappointed. As you would expect, lines are probably the biggest issue to navigate, so go in off peak times if available to you. Fast pass allows you to reserve a ride for later in the day, but be warned that you an only reserve one ride at a time. So I booked a space on a popular ride at 10am, with my allotted ride time being given as 6pm. This meant I couldn't use my fast pass again until I used it at the 6pm ride. Hope that makes sense. We also made the mistake of not looking at Disney events, and there was a marathon on when we arrived, which limited easy walking access to the park, and added to the crowds.Food is everywhere and caters to all tastes. It was fun choosing where to eat. Our biggest problem was finding food for the vegetarians in the family, so they lived on chips and mac and cheese. They were desperate for some vegetables no covered in sauces. Also, after a week, the idea of mostly deep fried or rich theme park food starts to feel a little sickening, and we struggled to find more simple, healthy options at times.Disney is expensive, but you would have guessed that.Character breakfasts were fun but terribly overpriced. The kids enjoyed a quick photo with popular characters, but this is also available throughout the park for free. The food at the character dining buffet was very greasy with hotdogs, pizza, candy etc all in the breakfast buffet and limited fruit healthy cereal options. With a lot of walking and eating, a simple breakfast would have been preferred to start the day. Also make sure the kids buy autograph books to collect the signatures of the characters you meet, as we were not aware of this activity and missed out on the first day.Staying onsite certainly helped, as we could come and go to our room as we pleased. You also get the early bird entry. All Disney hotels are walking distance. This helps with kids on a long day as the fireworks aren't until late at night. The fireworks were very busy, so get there early. From speaking with staff I understand that lots of locals turn up for this so crowds rapidly increase in size.It is hard to capture this holiday in words, and on re reading this does sound a little negative. The reality is that regardless of crowds, costs etc, this is a magical holiday for all ages. We loved it and want to return at Xmas to see the park all dressed up. We are planning our next holiday to Disney World in Florida later this year.",Disneyland_California

103771618,5,2011-04-01,United Kingdom,"Just back from our second visit to Disneyland Paris and loved every minute of it! The sunny weather was a bonus. The new Mickey show at 7.00pm is worth hanging around for, but don't stand on the right side or you'll be facing into the sun as we found out. Also, the stewards stopped us from joining the queue to see Rapunzel and we nearly missed out. If this is on your must do list queue early and don't leave it until your last day. She's beautiful and lovely to the children. Flynn is there too.If you have prepaid vouchers for the princess lunch check the small print to see if it includes wine. They changed the menu as of 6th April and it now includes only a soft drink. However, if you've already paid for this in UK, chances are yours will include wine..... for a short time anyway. We stayed at Santa Fe again as it's clean and much cheaper than the others. Breakfast is a bit of a bun fight and tables are scarce. So, we chose to go for breakfast at ten which meant the place was much more civilised and instead stayed out late. Our six year old daughter coped with this so it may be worth considering. The walk to the park is lovely about 15 minutes from the hotel.Our daughter loved Cafe Mickey, but choose the steak with a baked potato. Yummy! Remember to reserve a table. We liked an upstairs window seat as it overlooked the lake and was a bit quieter than downstairs.All in all it's a multi sensory holiday and you'll come back buzzing in more ways than one.

139442801,4,2012-09-01,Canada,"Disneyland is magical no matter how you cut it, but the disaster of Radiator Springs was a bit too much. The ride broke down 5 times in one day, and we took a last ditch effort 5 minutes before closing ... we waited about 35 minutes and got on but it wasn't worth the wait ... or the stress of wondering if waiting at midnight with a 6 year old for a ride that may or may not be working by the time we get there, was a good idea. I felt sorry for the people who waited 2.5 hours!That being said, of course the trip was great and the highlight of our son's summer, I just wish we hadn't worked our last day around waiting to get on that ride, and going back and forth between parks to facilitate it. We were told that this ride has been very unreliable. Advice? (1) Go on a magic morning and have someone line up right away so you're there when the park opens or (b) have someone line up there while someone gets a fast pass at park opening (fast passes are gone within 30 mins or 60 mins of opening on a busy day (3) or wait until the novelty of the ride passes and the lineups shorten and the staff work through the ride's glitches.",Disneyland_California

618246295,1,2018-09-01,United States,"Big Disney fan my whole life. I've been on multiple trips to Disneyland, Disney World, and Disneyland in Paris throughout my life. I loved them all. Our last trip to Disneyland (September 2018) was a complete nightmare. We picked one of the lowest seasons of the year, knowing that some rides and attractions would be closed. It was worth it for us because we thought we would be avoiding big crowds.Instead, we found many many rides closed, AND the biggest crowds we have ever seen there. Incredibly hard to walk around and get anywhere. Long lines at all the rides. Families stressed out and rushing all over the park. Horrible, horrible atmosphere.The magic is completely GONE. You can't even appreciate the beauty of the park because people are in the way. People are EVERYWHERE.If anyone remembers the magic and the music and simply strolling around and enjoying everything in sight (during low season), that is gone forever.All we found were stressed out moms, sweating and pulling their kids all over the park, racing to get to rides before everyone else did. If you don't rush, you're doomed.Remember when you would run into characters and actually be able to spend some time with them? That does not happen anymore. If you want to spend 3 seconds with Minnie, stand in line for at least 20min. If you're lucky, you'll get to her. Normally you won't, and have to wait some more for the next character. If you want to say hi to Captain America or Spiderman or Black Panther, be prepared to wait in line for 40min or longer.This is LOW SEASON, people. I can't even imagine the park being fuller than it was. It seemed impossible to us that more people could fit. But when we went, crowd levels were at 2 10!!!!Cast members are no longer kind and warm. They are all completely stressed out and rude and even mean. No wonder. Their job of keeping things together is very hard.Horrible, horrible and very disappointing experience for my whole family. I had spent years telling my kids all about the magic of Disneyland, and none of it is left.If Disney doesn't limit crowds somehow, I don't think we'll ever be going back. The park is beautiful. The rides are great. The crowds are the problem. They create the stressful competitive rude atmosphere that makes everything feel like a big fat race.",Disneyland_California

523121786,3,2017-09-01,France,"I'm a native Californian who has been to Disneyland in Anaheim probably 100 times (no joke), so obviously I have a bias. Many beautiful memories have been created there.In 2013, my grown daughter and I were in Paris and decided to go to Disneyland. We had no idea what to expect, except we thought it would be similar to the Anaheim park. Wow, were we disappointed. We knew right away that something was amiss when we heard no music playing at the entrance. There wasn't a flower to be seen anywhere (this was in April!), and we were actually starving for food. I mean, no food at Disneyland? Criminal. We found just ONE restaurant open, and the food was mediocre to terrible. A real disappointment. The rides, too, were quite different from the original    mostly rollercoasters (even Indiana Jones). Overall, it was a depressing experience, and we vowed never to go back.And then ... we decided to give it another try. We went again in early Sept. 2017, on a day that ended up being pretty rainy and blustery. But up until then, we were pleasantly surprised at the improvements they have made to the park (both the Disneyland side and the Studios side). There was wonderful music playing everywhere and flowers blooming (although they could still do more with the landscaping). New rides had come along, including Ratatouille, which we loved. The whole Pirates area was pretty cool, too. While the park still doesn't have the sparkle and magic of the original Disneyland, it has charm. The light and fireworks show on the castle at night was well done.The people running the rides seemed to genuinely enjoy their jobs, and they were fun to interact with. We had fun in both parks.Having said that, we noticed two major problems: 1) The food: Where is it? Yes, this time there were a few more places open, but most of the small carts served exactly the same thing (weird!). Also, at dinnertime    and in the rain    we searched for an open restaurant, and nearly all of them were closed. What? We finally found one that was open, where an average dinner started at $25! We wandered around (getting soaked) and finally found one place that was more reasonably priced. But we passed restaurant after restaurant that were closed at 7 pm. What gives? The food we did eat was passable, but not very good. This time, we brought our own lunch    we saw a lot of other people doing the same thing. They're losing a lot of money by not fixing this problem. But we thought for sure we'd be able to find a decent place for dinner. Wrong!2) The service: They need to hire more people. This was evident in both the shops and the food service areas, where service was so slow, it was ridiculous. At one of the small food carts, we waited 10 minutes to get to the front of the line    and we were behind ONE person! But we were so hungry, we decided to stick it out. The park also isn't as clean as it should be. We noticed trash in some areas, which we never see at the Disneyland in Anaheim. The bathrooms were OK but could be shinier. This park could be so much better with some minor adjustments: more and tastier food options, more service workers, more attention to the look and feel (more flowers and fun things to look at, please!), some better rides (get rid of the Rock 'n' Rollercoaster, that was actually silent    no rock music playing, which was bizarre). But the park is improving. Perhaps it was gussied up for its 25th anniversary and won't stay that way, but I hope that they keep going in this direction. If so, then we would go back, since we now live nearby.If you're an American who has been to the original Disneyland, going to this park will seem a bit surreal to you. Like it's ALMOST Disneyland, but not quite.",Disneyland_Paris

A recent visit enabled an interesting comparison, and the score card is not promising:1. Disneyland park and rides: how did my favourite rides match up to their counterparts in the U.S.? Not easy to ascertain... pirates of the Caribbean   closed for repair; A small world : closed for refurbishment ; space mountain (or rather their exciting new ride Hyperspace Mountain)   sounded promising given the screaming going on while we were waiting in the queue, however the ride broke down for the 2nd time that day 20 mins into our wait   so we were told to come back later.... At least the Haunted Manor did not disappoint (and was open, which was a bonus). 3 out of 4 of our favourite rides open   strike 1.2. Fastpass    Board within a matter of minutes  is how this service is described on the eurodisney website. The waiting time for our ride was 50 mins, so we showed up with our fastpass tickets at the allotted time and were in the queue for 40 mins... define  fast . Strike 2.3. Food and drink in the park   many reviews are already out there complaining about the   6 drinks and   10 sandwiches, so we won't repeat the overstated; let us instead focus on where you can consume these overpriced items. We were lucky enough to visit Eurodisney in brilliant weather and noticed several nice spots where we could sit down with our drinks and which were surprisingly empty   mystery solved: we tried to bring food and drink to the outdoor tables only to be told that food and drink were only sold to be consumed in the dark rooms that were the indoor dining spaces. Perfect on a cold winters day   not so good when wanting to take advantage of the sunshine. Strike 3.4. Disney hotels. My husband was there for a conference so my daughter and I tagged along for 2 nights. The New York hotel was our appointed hotel and as such a special check in lane has been designated for the members of this conference   but just the one lane out of 6 in the check in area. With more conference participants lining up to check in at the time we arrived than there were regular guests, the check in process was long and arduous as just one person was there to check everyone in and hand them their welcome packs. Some welcome. Strike 4.5. The room: more specifically cleaning thereof. I could say that I cannot comment as during our 2 night stay we saw no evidence of cleaning and did not see the maid once. No wait   we did see the trolleys in various parts of the corridors, however our room did not get made up. Granted, on the first day we did not leave the room until after 10am   this had never been a problem in other hotels so the next day we tried a different approach   leaving the hotel room earlier. Sadly this was no more effective and we returned yet again to a room of unmade beds and damp towels. The problem might be the  do not disturb  sign which is left on the door as we spent half an hour in the room after breakfast getting ready to visit the sights. On the third day with the conference being in full swing, my husband was out of the room by 8am. He returned to the room at noon for a shower and change of clothes (by which time the room still had not been done) and at that time put on the do not disturb sign... the maid fairies had obviously been lying in wait, as they chose that precise hour, noon to 1pm, to pounce and attempt to clean the room. They changed back into pumpkins at precisely 1.01 pm, so unfortunately he managed to notch up yet another day of no bedding or towel change. A call to reception revealed that there is no set time for the maid to pass, but once she has done your area that is it   she will not return that same day. No clean towels nor made up beds for 3 nights. Strike 5.6. The bathroom: the New York hotel is themed, as the name indicates, after the big apple. Pictures of skyscrapers adorn the rooms and halls, and in the bathroom a rather worn looking shower curtain is emblazoned with the NY Mets logo. Now while I do enjoy a good baseball game, if I want to see their emblem on my skin a tattoo might be an option   rather than the feeling of a cold wet shower curtain sticking to you (as well as every other previous users) while you shower. Haven't shower curtains been replaced with glass partitions in most good hotels? Strike 6.7. On the subject of bathrooms, I was eager to try out the ubiquitous array of free toiletries which are usually on offer in good hotels. But wait   there were none. Just a Mickey Mouse themed bottle of body lotion. Why only body lotion I wonder... does the stay leave you with dry body skin as well as frayed nerves... or does the shower curtain annoy patrons so much that they do not stay long enough to wash their hair? To make matters worse, on the before last day (when the room was finally visited by the cleaner) our handy travel size Bulgary soap (brought along especially for when hotel room soaps run out and are not replaced...) vanished from the bathroom. God giveth   and God taketh away... Strike 7.8. The hotel bars: we tried 2 different hotels in the resort and in both places you need to make sure that you have plenty of time set aside to enjoy the experience and that you polish off your dance moves as  wave your hands in the air like you don't care  is the only way you will get served. Still unsure as to what topic of conversation behind the bar kept the bar staff so enthralled, but at least we got an upper body workout.. strike 8.9. Minibar   do not make the mistake we did by removing anything from the fridge   they are automatically charged to your room within seconds of being removed from their sensor pads. Like Indiana Jones in the famous scene from raiders of the lost ark, we removed a drink from the fridge to take a closer look at what kind of water was being charged at   4 a bottle, but unlike Indy we did not had a bag of sand of equal weight to quickly replace on the sensor pad, and a call to reception confirmed that we had been charged for the item(s) removed. With no free bottles of water laid on for guests in the room like so many hotels do, Indiana Jones' worn water gourd looked better and better... Strike 9.It is however not all doom and gloom   unlike the maid service, the minibar checkers come to the room daily, without fail, to tally up and replace as need be any overpriced beverages that have been consumed. A call to reception to request clean towels is swiftly followed though with a member of staff bringing these to the room within 10 minutes. They did not enquire as to why we needed these so I assume that the lack of maid service means that requests for clean towels occurs on a regular basis. And finally, when the hotel restaurant is unavailable to guests as it has been booked out for various functions, they are quick to recommend and book other restaurants in the resort   with main courses starting at no less than   25....The only people having fun at Disneyland Paris these days are the ones sitting behind the tills.... If you can't say something nice, say nothin' at all... . Sorry Bambi.",Disneyland_Paris
301054412,4,2015-02-01,United Kingdom,we had a lovely day out and the queues werent  bad and the weather was lovely  the park was clean and the staff where all happy  it was easy to get there by car,Disneyland_California

319974937,3,2015-10-01,Australia,"I think the title says it all really.Must admit I had very high expectations for Disneyland   after the movies , the hype , everyone knows and loves Disneyland  right ?Well here are the facts from my trip in October :1. Dangerously overcrowded   literally couldn't move in some spots. People in every inch   shoving , pushing   no personal space.2. Lack of bathroom facilities   every one was packed and filthy   when you could find one.3. No sun protection ! Most lines are in the baking sun .4. Waiting over an hour for every , single ride  fast pass does nothing as you can only do one ride at a time.5. Where are all the characters? Oh right inside little rooms that you have to queue for an hour to see  where is the magic?6. Shows ? Where ? There are some random Star Wars Jedi things and we saw one parade which was incredible   I felt that Disney Magic for the 20 min it came past   the detail was lovely.7. Rides  ok   most are robot based which is cute   Indiana Jones was actually incredible  after the 80 min wait as was Splash Mountain. The theming and sets cannot be faulted and all rides went all day without fault which was great.8. Staff were friendly and courteous considering the crowds and were doing their best with what they had.Overall   for me, I could squish the highs and fun I had at Disneyland into about 1 hour   the other 14 I spent in lines :( Was it worth the wait for those moments ? I thought so that night   then I went to Universal the next day and saw how amazing a theme park can be ! Disney needs to lift its game and could learn a lot from Universal with regards to crowd management and planning.",Disneyland_California
285526414,3,2014-08-01,United States,"While in Paris last year I took one day to visit Disneyland Paris. Being a avid Disney Park goer, how could I not go. The Disney's Paris Magic Kingdom is definitely the most beautiful of all the Magic Kingdoms. The grounds are unbelievable. However the one most important thing missing is the cast member friendliness. Now they are not rude but you can definitely tell that this is just a job for them. The rides (especially Phanton Manor Best Disney Haunted Mansion) are great and the food is actually more superior than that of the other Disney parks. But unfortunately the  Disney Magic , you don't feel it there. If you are a big Disney Park fan like me and happen to be in Paris, definitely check it out. However make it one of your last destinations in Paris. Don't make it your priority. The train ride out there is fun and you'll see beautiful country side. Great break for kids while in Paris.",Disneyland_Paris
470979221,4,2017-03-01,Australia,"I love DisneyLand, I have been twice now, and have just taken my family back for their first experience. This time was slightly disappointing, the parade got cancelled because it was sprinkling rain, lots of rides were down & parking a pram at the beginning of a wait line takes a toll on your arms holding a heavy baby for up to 1hr. But none the less we had a good day despite these few things. The food was yummy & reasonably priced, the rides we did get on were fun and exciting and we got to meet Mickey Mouse & Darth Vader. I do wish though there were more characters walking around, there weren't many at all.",Disneyland_California
491473220,5,2017-06-01,United States,Was in LA on business and my hotel was almost opposite the park so decided to go in for the evening. Had a great time but was surprised how much smaller it was compared to Orlando which I've frequented many times. Was disappointed that they didn't do a twilight ticket price for visitors like myself entering the park after 5pm   it was still the full daily rate of $110.,Disneyland_California
185779627,3,2012-12-01,United States,"It's a small, small world with plenty to get excited about for a family with kids.  There are only two rides of interest for teens and adults, but overall worth the trip for people living in Asia.  Stay at least two nights at the Disnetland...More",Disneyland_HongKong
305508129,5,2015-05-01,United States,"What hasn't already been said about Disneyland? It's magical. Maybe I can provide a few helpful tips. All year long when we go to the grocery store or anyplace that has Disney gifts cards, we get one. It's the easiest way to save. If I try to stash cash away, I usually end up taking it out when I need a few bucks...and I never replace it. When I get gift cards, they're spendable at most places in the Parks (food & souvenirs) and some places Downtown Disney. Prior to one trip, we saved $1000 in gift cards. That was $1000 we didn't really feel during our planning months, and it was $1000 less off of our debt credit cards while we were on our trip! We try to fly into either Long Beach or Santa Ana (aka: Orange County or John Wayne) as they're sometimes cheaper than LAX and closer to Disneyland, so the ride to the hotel is cheaper  about a $45 cab ride from either, vs about $100 cab from LAX. As Beautiful as the Disney's Grand California hotel is, we usually stay for 6 11 days each trip and I cannot justify paying that much...so we don't. Paradise Pier is great but it's too far for us to walk (every step counts with little kids) so if we stay on property, we do the Disneyland hotel. You get all the amenities of all 3 Disney hotels, plus the kiddos like the pool best. (Plus when you stay at one of the 3 Disney hotels, you get into the the parks an hour early.) It's still about a 20 minute walk for us to the gate though. (If you remember it from the good of' days, the monorail doesn't pull right up to it anymore.). The closest hotels to the park entrance are the Best Western Park Place and the Park Vue Inn. We don't spend very much time at the hotel so we look for cleanliness and location, without paying an arm and a leg. Both of those are good, and you just cannot beat the location. Our new favorite right now is an oldie but a goodie   the Howard Johnson. Besides location, a bonus of staying off (Disney) property, is food selection. When we stay on property, we tend to limit ours food choices to whatever is in the park (I love the Chimichangas from the carts in the park!). When we stay on Harbor Blvd, we eat a lot of McDonald's and IHOP cuz they're so handy. I've heard that even places like IHOP have higher prices near the park than they do at home though. The Howard Johnson is a little further than the other 2 hotels, but the pool is super kid friendly and the hotel seems brighter and happier than the Park Vue or BW. As for the parks themselves...we try to never go in September because it's waaaay too hot for us Pacific Northwesterners. We loved February because it was way less crowded BUT then you run the risk of more rides being closed for refurbishment and weather may not be super awesome. It kind of misted on us one day so the park pretty much cleared cleared out. We were able to stay on Big Thunder 4 times in a row without getting off because there was no line. Park hours are also shortened in  off season   but sometimes this is a good thing! We also love Halloween time. They close the park early some days and you can buy Halloween Party tickets to get back in. There are trick or treat stations everywhere, costumes, special parade, dancing, etc. At Christmastime, it  snows . For character dining, we like Breakfast With Minnie & Friends in Disneyland at Carnation Plaza. It's a buffet and for 4 of us, it's costs around $75. We had the most character time there. We had the least amount of Character time at Ariel's Grotto, and Goofey's Kitchen is hit or miss. Surf's Up breakfast at Paradise Pier is good enough, but $$$. We also try to eat at the Blue Bayou, which is the restaurant inside Pirates of the Carribbean. If you make reservations, you can dine there and get special reserved seating on the ground for Fantasmic, which we LOVE! Adults like to eat at Carthay Circle in CA Adventure, but our kiddos don't like it . The Corn Dogs at Disneyland are a must, especially at parade time while you sit on the curb, but get in line early!! The Chocolate parfaits at the Tomorrowland Terrace are a must get, but a little rich, so even though you may want your own, don't be afraid to share. I try, but can't finish one on my own. There's a Starbucks in each park. We also like to eat a lot of fruit from the fruit stand near the Jungle Cruise. If you have kiddos, go to the Tomorrowland Terrace a half hour before Jedi Training so they can learn to fight with light sabers. If it's super hot out, go to the Enchanted Tiki Room, where you get Dole Whips. The room has great air conditioning and you can simply sit and watch the show. The best non ride thing to do, hands down, is the Aladdin show at California Adventure. In Carsland, the Radiator Springs ride is great, but the fast passes run out early in the day. Fast passes are near Bugsland. Adult beverages are only in California Adventure. If you need to chill, go to the Big Thunder Ranch area. Behind the petting zoo is a stage with great performers, and adults can sit while kiddos hang with characters that aren't typically seen, like Thumper, Claribelle, the ugly step sisters, etc. When it's super hot, the island you can explore in the Rivers of America gets really dry and dusty. If it's your first time into the park, expect to go thru security. You can take food in. Some people line up to get in as early as 2 hours before the park opens. Shops stay open inside and outside the parks for an hour after the parks close. Get a locker inside the parks. There are 3 sizes prices. You set the code so you can open and close it all day long till the parks close. Put jackets, water bottles, souvenirs, whatever in them. In Disneyland, they're on Main Street on the right, near the fruit stand. In CA Adventure, they're on the right at the beginning of Buena Vista Street when you first walk in....I'd better shush. HAVE FUN!!!",Disneyland_California
327808202,4,2015-10-01,Philippines,One day is not enough when you are travelling with small kids. they usually want to take their sweet time. Water is expensive at 28 HK$. Make sure you don't go during peak season so you will have shorter lines at the rides. The parade did not dissapoint. The river cruise is only nice during the day.,Disneyland_HongKong
220611046,4,2014-02-01,United Kingdom,"Great day out in the sun, plenty of rides and shows and in February the queues were manageable.  My only quibble was that there only two Disney princesses (Snow White and Aurora) but there were plenty of other characters to meet.",Disneyland_HongKong
265405366,5,2015-04-01,South Africa,highlight of our Paris trip by far. The two parks were incredible to experience and the rides are different to the Hong Kong and Orlando parks which I have also previously visited. Lines can get long so do plan you day allow time for queues.Did the 1 day 2 park pass which allowed us to do about 10 12 rides over the course of the day across the 2 parks.Go early and use the train as Its cheap and quick and runs late till after the spectacular fireworks show before they close the park each day.,Disneyland_Paris

588914729,5,2018-06-01,United Kingdom,"Had a fantastic trip, aided by the weather as sun shone for all 4 days. Adults and kids all had plenty to entertain them. The fireworks and light show was spectacular. Both 2 & 6 year olds were blown away by meeting their favourite characters while and very pleased that there were so many age appropriate rides for them to enjoy. Sadly can't do it every weekend but the memories created during the trip will stay for a long time  Noticed one big difference since last Disney visit with our kids some 20 years ago   lots of adults with head down on their phone screen    while in queue rather than interacting and sharing the excitement with their kids",Disneyland_Paris
118356597,4,2010-12-01,United States,Visited the park on the 29th december as part as my little girls christmas present. We arrived way before the park and managed to get into the park quite fast. When you visit its best to plan your day first using the maps so you dont waste any time we decided to go onto the disney studios first and as it was till early and quiet we managed to get on a few rides n the kids area still had to queue for aout 15 minutes though and that was when it was quiet. We watched the car show in the big areana which was fantastic but get there early to save the queues and to get a good seat. When we come out of there we were amazed at how packed the park was we went to go on some rides and the wait times were 90 minutes plus which was crazy. So we decided to go onto the other park which was just as bad as we could'nt get on any rides the main street was heaving with people. The best part about it was how christmassy the setting was it was beautiful. We watched a few of the shows which were good the parts we did see in between trying to dodge peoples heads. As we did'nt want to wait for the rides we had a walk round sleeping beautys castle which was beautiful. For dinner we decided to use mcdonalds on disney village the queues were horrendous think it took around 45 minutes to get served i think we paid around 18 euros for 3 meals which i did'nt think was bad being on a disney park. Not many space to sit down to eat had to wait for a table. There is plenty of places to eat all over the parks. There are some lovely shops too so be prepared to spend lots of money cause there is some beautiful gifts and always good to buy a pen and autograph book for when you see mickey or minnie. We bought a little minnie mouse playset in a bag and was about 16 euros. Some may think its expensive on the parks we did'nt think it was overly expensive as we expected it cause as with all attractions whether its in england or another country its always going to be abit more highly priced thats how they make there money as they know people will spend when their there.After dinner we decided to just walk round and look at all the scenery etc we was'nt going to attempt to go on any rides by around 2pm my little girl had only been on 2 rides and she was starting to get upset. We managed to get to see the parade which is amazing out of this world and got to see santa and his reindeers.So we wee happy we saw that after the parade finished many of the people were starting to go home and as we were on the park till 10 pm it gave us chance to run round the park and jump on the rides so we managed to get on alot of them as we could just get straight on. The small world ride is a must its a boat ride and its all dolls based in scenes in different countries it was fantastic how much work had gone into into it. The peter pan flight is also a good one and buzz's flight. We had an evening meal in pinochios restaurant which was lovely too cant remember how much that was think it was about 25 euros which was'nt bad either. By the time 10pm come we were all knackered and had banging headaches could'nt wait to get back to hotel. We would go again but it would have to be when all the kids were at school so we could enjoy the park being christmas and how busy it was you cant enjoy it as much it just seems so stressful. The good thing about going christmas is how christmassy it feels there the shops and main street are all set out beautifully oh and the castle at night is absolutley stunning with all the twinkly christmas lights and tinkerbell blowing here magic sparkle dust out from the top of it it truly is a magical christmas here but way to busy.,Disneyland_Paris
217894376,4,2014-07-01,United Kingdom,"We went to the park for an evening visit.It was fun and we did not have to queue too long to get on the rides we wanted to try (Twilight Tower of Terror, Space Mountain etc).We caught the show and fireworks at the end of the night and that was pretty spectacular to watch.Great fun for big kids!",Disneyland_California
128302620,4,2012-03-01,Australia,"While this park is definitely smaller than Disneyland in Anaheim, there is still that Disney magic. There is definitely a lack of thrill rides, but it bothered my husband more than me. I was happy enough just taking in all the Disney details. The Jungle Cruise is excellent, and I loved Mickey's Philharmagic and The Golden Mickeys. I really enjoyed the parade, and the fireworks. We did struggle to find food we liked, but I had a nice curry at the Royal Banquet Hall, and some nice desserts from the Main Street Bakery.

533469071,2,2017-10-01,Finland,"Went here with our family. Despite Disneyland Paris getting great reviews I tend to disagree. We went on a Monday in October (not French school holidays) to avoid the crowds. Still, every attraction had a waiting time of roughly 30 45 minutes and some longer. The food is as expected overpriced and bad. Don't see what you can get out of a day here, when you spend most of the time waiting for a few attractions (there are only a handful of them, the rest are parks and shops). Cannot recommend. Have never visited the US Disneyland, perhaps it's better.",Disneyland_Paris
243391457,3,2014-10-01,Australia,"This is a really disappointing part of our holiday. They really cater towards the younger kids which was a shame as we had been saving to go to Disney for 20  years. The lines were ridiculous and the amount of screaming children, angry parents, and fed up employees really made the day long and horrible. To meet the characters we were turned away or told to join a massive line for tickets. The food was disgusting and overpriced. Being yelled at by the employees to move when the parade was on was truly a highlight. We spent 10 hours here and I was done after about an hour. Sorry future children, I will never go back.",Disneyland_California
120430437,5,2011-01-01,India,"Well this was a dream come true for us. Forget the other members, it was me who was very excited to visit the place   the cartoon characters whom I have grown up with. It is advisable to purchase the tickets through the tour operators as it would be cheaper to include both entry ticket cost & transportation. We started from LA and after appr couple of drives reached the location. There was huge queue at the entrance and we managed to enter after waiting for over 20 mins. Once we entered inside     wow Goofy and Minnie were there to welcome us    There are plenty of things  activities in the park which could keep you engaged for a very long time and one is oblivious to the time. At the entrance there is a small museum which details the history of Walt Disney with Disneyland growing. There is the train ride in the park     outer circle which take you around the entire place. It is advisable to carry the park map with you and plan the trip accordingly. Do not miss out the parade and the wonderful laser show in the evening.During our stay in LA, we went twice to be completely engrossed and allured to the Disneyland     the original birthplace of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge",Disneyland_California

180906926,5,2013-09-01,United Kingdom,"I'd been to  EuroDisney  3 or 4 times, but the last time was 10 years ago. We decided to return in 2013 with our two boys, aged 6 and 4. We went the first week of September, and the French schools had just gone back, so not as busy as it would have been earlier in the summer. The longest queue we had was 1 hour for Crush's Coaster, but other than that the longest we waited in line was about 30 mins.A couple of things: If you can, I'd recommend going for at least two full days. We had 4 days and easily filled them all (with one day spent in the Studios park) and this really took the pressure off of having to get everything done in 1 2 days, which you will struggle to do unless it's a very quiet time of year.Also, do a little planning, even if it's just noting which rides and things you REALLY want to do. Then focus on getting those done, either by getting to them first thing or last thing in the day when it's quieter, or using fast pass, or just biting the bullet and queuing up for it but at a time you're prepared to queue!Other than being there longer, the best thing you can do is get there EARLY! If you're staying in a Disney hotel, the Magic Hours (getting in at 8am) is worth doing, even just once, to get on a few Discovery Fantasyland rides with little or no queues. We did the Buzz Lightyear ride about 4 times back to back with no queues at all, also Space Mountain and Orbitron all in under an hour first thing, then were first in the queue for Star Tours when it opened at 10. Again, it takes the pressure off getting to those rides when the park is busier later on.Use the Fast Pass system. It does work fine. Sometimes the FP time is later in the day, but it's worth doing, especially on busier days. Our kids understood if we got a fast pass we could come back later and walk on, which helped steer them away from getting into longer queues.One for people with kids   We messed up our times and kept missing the kids normal meal times. We didn't realise we'd done this and didn't understand why they were going crazy! But when you're in the park normal life routine doesn't apply :) So make sure you feed the kids at their normal meal times, it'll help them cope with the excitement and tiredness.You will get worn out... we did 10 13 hour days all 4 days we were there... so try and take a break now and then :) Take water bottles and re fill them for free (water stations are by all toilet areas). Food is expensive, so prepare. Either budget to spend the money (use DLRP Magic website for menu examples) or take food in with you. We did a bit of both and it worked ok. The Free Half Board deal worked well for us and encouraged us to sit down for a proper meal for an hour, which is a great chance for a rest!Remember to enjoy it :) Yes, some people don't queue properly... but don't let it ruin your time there. Rise above it and look around at the amazing place you're in!Have fun... we'll be back again in a couple of years.",Disneyland_Paris
616413011,3,2018-08-01,United States,"We visited here with a 2 day 2 park pass in August whilst staying at Eurocamp at Vic Sur Aisne. Slightly reduced price as purchased through Picniq website before hand. You have to see Disney to experience the charm etc. My girls are 10 and 13 years too old for princesses but too young (it would seem) for big rides. We basically spent all day queuing. The shortest queue was 60 minutes for a 3 minute ride! If you have older kids I would highly recommend big thunder mountain. We also went on Peter pan (1hr 20 min queue), Buzz lightyear laser (1hr 15 min) and around Alice's curious labyrinth but TBH the queues were not worth it   probably magical though with younger ones. The Fast Pass system is not what it is sold to be personally speaking. We got there as soon as it opened and the first pass we got was for 12.30 pm. You have to use that prior to obtaining the next one, by that time the next pass was for 5.30 pm! The food is extortionate and not a lot of what the kids would like unless you sit down at one of the main restaurants. We took a bag with us on the second day and crammed it with food and drinks   mainly to save time by eating whilst queuing and also so we knew there would be something they would eat!I sound a bit like a party pooper and i do love Disney but i won't be returning i'm afraid.",Disneyland_Paris

We love Disney so much but I have found people who don't grow up going or try to go as adults don't seem to enjoy it as much as we do. It is a incredible place for families to go. So much fun stuff to see and do it's hard to get it all in. I highly recommend 4 days minimum to try and get as much as you can. The only bad thing about it is it is very expensive!!! Do not go on holidays or summer breaks unless you can handle huge crowds and long wait times,Disneyland_California
317692878,3,2015-09-01,Australia,"Recently visited Disneyland HK with 8 year old in tow. Entry price seemed high but prepared to pay for the experience. Unfortunately the experience didn't live up to expectations. It didn't take long for waiting times on all rides to be 1 hour and access to eateries limited due to crowd numbers. When we did finally get to eat the prices were outrageous  I guess that's what you can get away with when you have a captive audience! We did really enjoy the Lion King show and the parade was great, so not all bad. Overall I thought the target audience was very much around the 4 to 8 year old, nothing much for older kids. For much better value we also visited ocean world HK where price was cheaper, rides and experiences much more appealing. My advice  skip Disneyland and spend your money at ocean world !",Disneyland_HongKong

Certainly, California Adventure had a hint of some Disney worlds attraction and Disney sea from Tokyo but twisted to its own unique way. Nicely done!Disney land itself has made a great change. Autopia was a longest and nicest go cart I have ever tried. Nimo's submarine was uniquely introducing the world of sea along with Nimo's adventure. Story telling boat was miniature, fantasy land. Very sadly, some famous  major attractions such as It's a small world, jungle cruise, train etc were refurbished or closed.Weekends were ridiculously crowded including food court  they really should think about  less congesting  strategy.

The food was great, the service was efficient and it was VERY clean.Unlike some other attractions we visited while in HK, even the toilets here were clean. we easily spent the day wandering around.

It was only 40min to the park from Chatelet.If you want to stay past 8pm, they recommend you pay $8 to take the train back, they really should have 2 busses, 1 at 8pm and 1 at 12am so you can see the fireworks. The sun doesn't set in the summer until after 10pm. Long lines but French people are not in a rush, so they're really just strolling and the line isn't as long as it says by like 10 15minThe Crush coaster is a must do!

521439900,1,2017-09-01,United States,"Disney fan at heart and have visited Disneyland in Hong Kong several times, so this review is a comparison between the two. Entering is chaotic and security personnel are just straight out rude and lack basic manners. When you are filled with excitement and joy visiting Disney, this is not what you'd expect to be greeted with. Lack of variety in merchandise within the stores, where the majority of goods are aimed at young children. Not much option or choice for adults. Despite visiting the park upon opening, the restrooms were on the poor side in terms of hygiene. The park is definitely bigger than Disney Hong Kong and offers more variety in rides. With that however, comes longer lines and wait times which is to be expected. For a quick meal you have a small range to choose from and are pre prepared so expect your food to be on the colder side. Hotter and  fresher  foods are available but after looking at reviews they either tend to be located within the Disney hotel or not worth the hefty price.",Disneyland_Paris

174838436,4,2012-09-01,United States,"To celebrate my son   s 8th birthday, we planned a one week Hongkong trip, which included a visit to Disneyland park, Ocean Park, and Science Museum (see separate reviews). I purchased a platinum Magic Access card for my son and one of his priveleges is free visit to the park any day of the year. For the rest of us, we bought the 2 day ticket which allows us to visit the park at any 2 days within a one week period. We made it a point to start and end our Hongkong trip with a Disney experience... so we checked in at Disney   s Hollywood Hotel for our first 2 nights, L    Hotel Island South (near Ocean Park) for 3 nights, then at Disneyland Hotel for our last night (see separate reviews for each hotel). We visited Disneyland park on our 2nd and 6th day in Hongkong. Our visit was in August 2012.If you are visiting summertime, like us, be prepared for a really hot day. You can discreetly bring a small bottle of water inside your bag through the park gate, the guards are not that strict. This will not suffice for the whole day though, and you will need to buy drinks later. Though we made sure to visit the park on a weekday and not Saturday nor Sunday, there were still a lot of people, thus the long queues. Having motion sickness, we are not really that into rides so we just walked around, looking at shops, taking photos, and eating when we feel like it. We did the train ride but it was not that special. My son liked the Astroblasters (shooting enemies of Buzz Lightyear with a laser gun while riding a boat) and It   s A Small World (a boat ride that allows you to view an enormous display of dolls from all over the world). Be sure to watch both The Lion King and The Golden Mickeys because they are wonderful, amazing shows that will be enjoyed by people of all ages! The Caravan show at Grizzly Gulch is also very good, and it included participation of kids in the audience...which my son enjoyed. Shows have several schedules during the day so don   t fail to look at schedule of shows, together with the map.Also, take note of the schedule and route of the parade so you can decide where you want to watch... and be in that location early to take your desired spot. The parade passes at a relaxed pace so you have ample time to take photos of the characters. This should not be missed if you have children with you.We watched the fireworks at around 9pm in front of the castle during our first Disneyland park visit day ...and it was amazing! Though watching the fireworks from our Hollywood Hotel park view room the night before already was a very good experience, watching it right infront of the castle was much better still.Be there early so you can sit at one of the few benches in front of the castle.Exploring the whole Disneyland park cannot be accomplished in one day of continuous walking if you have children and senior citizens with you. Checking in at one of the Disneyland resort hotels gives the advantage of being able to rest at the hotel when you get tired then going back to the park later in the day. This is easy because free shuttle buses regularly go around the resort with stops at the 2 hotels and the park. And after a very tiring day in the park, it   s comforting to have the shuttle bus waiting to bring you to the hotel. Though it is a long walk going out of the park, you know you will be in your room after just a few minutes of bus ride.",Disneyland_HongKong

The queues for the rides were very long and the fast pass system very unclear. My kids don't complain, they got to wave to Queen Elsa and Princess Anna and that pretty much made their day.

The negatives   other rides were pedestrian with tired ineffective animatronics   Pirates of the Caribbean and the Haunted House in particular.

237316374,2,2014-10-01,United Kingdom,"We bought a 4 days for the price of 3 ticket but feel we didn't need that long as we had had enough after 2 days really. Being half term we did expect it to be busy but the queues were very long particularly the 'thrill' rides. Although these usually had fast passes you had to wait a long time to use these and for certain rides could only go once eg Ratatouille or wait over 60 minutes to go again. I was particularly disappointed with the princess pavilion my daughter and I queued for 75minutes to see ONE princess. They also forgot to ask if we had met any before so we were put in the line for Cinderella. When I realised that was it, I complained, initially I was told this was my fault but eventually the person at the front realised their mistake and we met Ariel. My daughter was disappointed because Cinderella (who we had met at the Auberge for dinner) had led us to believe that we would see Belle at the Pavilion. I Could not believe you only saw one princess. Having been fortunate enough to have been to Disney in the US when we lined up to see the characters in Epcot there were 5  to see. There were also many more encounters within the parks without the painful wait. We too disliked the number of smokers within the park that had no regard for children non smokers. We took our own food and drink in which did save us some money entry was enough!! We bought popcorn at great expense!Have to agree with comments about the condition we too noted various cars in rides that were not in use and this surely prolonged the wait times. Regarding baby swap  this seems to cater for families of 4 not 5 or more. If the parent who was looking after the baby or child too small for a certain ride then wished a turn they had to chose between the child they travelled with rather than go as a unit like the other parent had before. This led to arguments between the children who were both keen to go again. Did enjoy the fireworks but agree these should be done earlier. We went on Halloween when the park closed at 7pm so they were 20 minutes before and our 5y old could watch which was great. Otherwise they were at 9.40 which is just too late.

We were in the park 14 hours per day.Some tips to have a more enjoyable trip:1. Plan your trip like we did to star your visit the day California kids go back to school in mid August. This is the biggest drop off in attendance...lines are shorter.2. Use Fast Pass for the most populated rides.3. Even though you may be in a group use the singles lines whenever possible. You will save many hours of line wait by doing this.4. Bring in your own food and water. You will save a lot of money. You cannot bring in glass, but plastic bottles of drinks are fine.5. Wear very comfortable shoes because you will walk and stand a lot.6. In the summer bring your water frozen. It will melt quickly and you will stay cooler.7. Take a shuttle to the park.Ride the train around the park. It is a really nice thing to do.Be patient with your kids....meaning make sure you get a good nights rest before you come to the park.",Disneyland_California

Try to book well ahead, when they have some promotions   follow their website and get newsletters. We managed to get 2 parks tickets for 49 Euros pp, which is a bargain  Visit on weekday, not on weekend (there're still crowds, but less),  Come at opening time to enjoy less crowds, from 11 onward it gets very busy,  if you came at opening time go FIRST at the most popular rides, NOT on the rides you see first   you'll have no wait or 5 min wait, which will be a 45  wait shortly,  if you don't mind riding separately do go on the single line, you'll be quickly on the ride,  buying a fastpass is money consuming option, the bigger family the more it costs, so it's up to you, but if you follow the above rules you wont need it.",Disneyland_Paris

If you've been to the Magic Kingdom in Orlando then just forget Disneyland Paris exists. It's like an Alton Towers theme park but in France with 'cast members' who could not care less whether you have a nice time or not. I got shouted at by one cast member and we lost count of the number of cast members who were rude or looked like they were waiting for their shift to finish. The cast members dressed up as characters were good though   they must have earned their wings at the Disney University! Toilets   they were a disgrace every single time, and when you have small children you certainly visit them frequently! Toilet paper on the floor, no paper in the holders, unflushed toilets, wet floors, and even a used sanitary product on one floor   yuck, yuck, yuck! The ladies toilets in the Plaza Gardens restaurant smelt worse than a tower block lift!Smoking   everywhere we went, even in the queues for the rides, there was smokers blowing smoke in our direction and even in our faces, not to mention the cigarettes were held at small child height. Hence why the paths are littered in cigarette ends, add this to people dropping litter and it certainly does not reach the cleanliness we have seen in a lot of other Disney parks.We walked out of the Disneyhotel towards the nearest turnstiles to enquire whether we could enter there or had to walk around to which a young male cast member just looked at us, tutted and said  It says exit up there!  and turned his back. What is wrong with  Sorry Sir, you can't enter here, but if you walk around the corner in that direction they will be able to help you. ??? I was shouted at in the 'glass' shop because I wanted to pay for some rather expensive items but apparently I was at the wrong till, but there was no one at the other till.  You must go there!  the supervisor shouted at me (even though the young man had rung some items on the till) and placed the items back in my hands. The supervisor then started tutting under his breath and saying to the young assistant that people should use the correct till whilst he got his key to void the items on the till. What is wrong with  Very sorry Madam, you cannot use this till, but I will take them over there for you to pay ??? They were lucky I still bought them after I took a deep breath and resisted the urge to place them back down on his counter and walk out!Rides   kept pausing breaking down. In Phantom Manor the ride stopped 6 times   son was fed up! Thunder Mountain   we hardly saw going. Some rides looking dated and not that clean. Character meets   be prepared to queue or pay for it, and even when you do pay for it in the Disneyland park don't expect fab service (Dinner at Auberge du Cendrillon). We started to queue for our daughter to see Rapunzel, after an hour the queue had hardly moved. The cast member managing the queue then informed us that from where we were in the queue we would have a 3 hour wait! What? To meet a girl in a special dress? No way! I then noticed that there were in fact 2 queues, one for wheelchair users which were given priority and the other queue had to just slot in here and there. And as for the Princesses in the Princess Pavilion you had to queue to book a slot to see them and then then queue when turning up at your time slot. We didn't bother!There were fleeting glimpses of Disney magic   daughter's 'Princess for a day' make over was priceless, said daughter getting blown a kiss from Snow White on the Parade, the fabulous Disney Dreams light and firework show, and the waiter we had in the Silver Spur Steakhouse was lovely, very 'Disney' in his chattiness, but if we want some 'Disney magic' in the future we'll go back to America.There was various scaffolding in places, and diggers at the front entrance. Some Disney themed screens would have been nicer to hide the works going on.Come on Disney   sort it out! Spend some money on it, employ more staff and train them in the art of customer service!",Disneyland_Paris

650060498,4,2019-02-01,United Kingdom,"We went for two days over the weekend   bad mistake as a lot of things were closed for refurbishment which meant longer queues at other rides. This was also disappointing as instead of filtering the fast trackers through, they stopped the normal queues and let all of the fast trackers on first. this meant that some people where queuing for 80 mins!! The signage was almost non existent to find where the different areas were, and very little signs on toilet facilities and where to find them if you didn't have a map. The printed map was different from the app map too, so if you're going to use a map, just use one of them don't try both! We spoke to someone on the plane home and they had been for 4 days and Thurs Friday the park was empty so if you're going go during the week. Transport to and from the parks is great, with frequent buses. B&B hotel was a good hotel to stay in, friendly staff and it's only a 2 star but clean and comfortable ensuite rooms, with a good pizza pasta station and a bar for a rest at the end of the day which are open till 11pm.",Disneyland_Paris

534702605,3,2017-10-01,United Kingdom,"Having visited    big Disney   , as my children call it, in Floria last year, I was skeptical as to what    little Disney    would offer. As an adult, DLP does not compare in the slightest. We had the photopass plus included in our booking, at   69.99 to buy separately, I expected there to be photographers at various places in the park. In reality the photographers were only at certain character meets, and there were only photo ops on two or three of the rides. In the end I had a total of 10 photographs. That   s   7 per photo had I paid full price. Not exactly a bargain.On the other hand, I don   t think my kids would have any complaints at all. They loved it from start to finish. They are 5 and 3, there was a total of 4 rides my 5 year old was too small to get on, which was a nice change when compared to Florida. Overall, I would say that it is worthwhile taking younger children 4 8, who would be too small for most of the rides in    big Disney   .

We tend to go in the summer, and the crowds are worst in June, better in July, and slowing down in August. You have to watch August for when they start cutting back the hours, and allowing the third tier annual pass holders back into the park after being blocked all summer. Those can be some busy days. A good trick for saving some money is to bring empty water bottles and some of the powdered drink packets. You will save a ton of money on those 80  degree days.

240232807,4,2014-11-01,Ireland,If you buy into the Disney ethos then you will love this place. Once you are in you don't have to spend any money except for food and souvenirs so it can work out quite a cheap day if you bring your own food and resist the urge to splurge. The big downside is the queueing   it really can be a frustrating and tiring few days. If you are willing to go on rdies as a single ou will not have to queue at all and a lot of rides have the Fast Pass system which takes a bit of planning but can work out well. For thsoe rides that don't have Fast Pass and for those with younger children who will not want to go on rides alone (not many would) then prepare to queue for everything for a long time. Shops are ridiculously expensive but nobody forces you to buy the stuff and the prices are set based on what people will pay.if going in November december make sure you get the events programme and see the Christmas spectacular   it is a fantastic spectacle.,Disneyland_Paris

631439404,4,2018-10-01,United Kingdom,"So, it was early October, the weather was starting to turn from Tropical to cold, dark and depressing. We did have an excellent summer and to get away from the weather blues, my wife and I decided to take a trip to Disneyland Paris for the children's half term holiday towards the last week of October. Whats interesting is that we decided to take a road trip around Europe for the entire week on the back of this idea. I wont go into much detail about the other part of the trip and concentrate on Disneyland itself. I apologise! I love telling a story! More reviews to come for the other parts of the trip.Anyway, on to Disneyland Paris. Prices were reasonable for 2 day 2 park tickets (  450 for 2 adults and 2 children aged 5 and 6). We drove there and stayed in an apartment nearby (I will review that separately). First impressions were good. The park is well serviced by shuttle buses from the nearby hotels. The place is overall very clean. The staff (cast members) go above and beyond to serve you with the utmost attention and care. All the characters we met at both parks were constantly in  character  and smiling. My one reservation is that the place could do with more toilets. Or perhaps have more signage pointing towards toilets. Most of the toiler very clean with the exception of a few. My second qualm with this trip was that you can't just queue up and meet characters. You need to download an app (LINEBERTY) and pre book. The problem is the bookings for various character in the two parks open at 9.45 am on the day you wish to meet a character and when we (my wife and I) tried logging in to book character meets for my son and daughter the app kept telling us that we were too far from Disneyland Paris to book a meet. Bear in mind, we were less than 2 miles away. We decided to go to the park and book and the app showed we were in the park but still came up telling us that we were too far away (250 meters!!!!!) It was very frustrating and annoying because my daughters favourite characters were possible to meet by queuing up at princess pavilion but characters like Woody from Toy story, Mickey Mouse and Sully from Monsters Inc had to be booked via the app. And we were unable to do this. I would even have paid extra to have my son meet Woody (his favourite character of all time   for now!). But he never got to experience that. The other problem we had was the queue times. We booked fast pass tickets to avoid having to queue wherever possible but it appears that 80 to 90% of the rides and or attractions we wanted to experience were not offering fast track and we had to queue. My daughter really wanted to see Rapunzel as its her favourite character. So Ariel was the first up at 10:00 on the given day with Rapunzel immediately after at 15:00. We queued for nearly 2 hours to meet Ariel (who was lovely to the kids and made my daughter very happy). However by the time we got out we enquired about Rapunzel and were told that we would have to queue immediately again to meet Rapunzel. Which would have meant 4 hours in total of queuing to meet 2 princesses! My kids were shattered by this point and we couldn't bear going through the queuing ordeal all over again. Since my son wasn't able to meet any of his favourite characters and I wasn't able to pay for it. I read on another online forum that you can book a meal at one of the restaurants in the park (Cinderellas   Auberge de Cendrillon) and there are several princesses and other character who will meet and greet guests during their meal. The cost for this was relatively high and its one of the priciest lunches I've had since lunching at the Ritz a couple of years ago. I think the bill in total was approximately   250. Now we did get to meet 4 main Disney characters (Cinderella, Aurora, Merida and Snow white along with Cinderella's mice helpers). The kids were over the moon by meeting the characters, especially my daughter, but I think it was still a tad incomplete since she never got to meet Rapunzel as she likes to remind me! Nevertheless, she got way more than she could have bargained for and was a lot luckier than her younger brother who didn't get to meet and greet a single one of his favourite characters due to the poor app. Other than that, everything else was really good. The rides were fantastic, the food was good (although pricey), the parks were both generally very clean, the parades are great, characters and staff excellent, the fireworks displays at 22:00 are excellent (although I suggest finding a good view point earlier) and generally the place has a magical feel to it   take it from a 32 year old male who doesn't have a great interest in Disney. The staff all speak English and I also noticed that Spanish and German was also spoken by most staff. Excellent all around. I can't compare it to Walt Disney World as I've never been, but for what it is, it is Good!",Disneyland_Paris

It is definitely worth a visit, especially if you can't make it to the states. There was a couple of very noticeable areas that needed the extra Disney detail:1) A CM from Tower of Terror was wearing trainers, and was also present in the main Disney park stewarding the parade. This might seem very trivial but is against Walts idea of being immersed in the theme of a certain area2) The decor on some of the rides, e.g., Buzz Lightyear, is in desperate need of freshening up. I'm not talking about the actual ride figures, etc, that take downtime, I'm talking about the ride cars with half the paint missing.

Took us absolutely ages to get into the park and once we were in it was a nightmare! 90 minutes queue to see princesses, 2 hours for the teacup ride, all the cafes and restaurants here just sell burgers and pizza at absolutely ridiculous prices. Example we found McDonald's on the night we arrived, we started queuing at 7.30 pm we finally got served and started eating at 10.30pm!!!!!! 3 hours queue in a McDonald's if it wasn't for the fact I needed to feed my children I would have walked out much earlier. I bought 4 quarter pounder meals as this was pretty much all they did and a happy meal for my 2 year old and it came to   46!!!! I felt this place was awful we couldn't wait to get out of here! We visited in the February half term for 3 days, God knows how much worse it got in summer. Only good thing about it was the parades they were very pretty.

In the past 2 visits, I have been very pleased with the quality for the price. Yes, this was a smaller park, but the price reflected that. It didn't have a lot of people in it and this was a plus. You could ride on or go directly into any show or attraction, you wanted. The price for food and souvenirs was reasonable. That is all in the past. They have built new lands and new attractions in the last 10 years, not surprising and very welcome. However the price has risen also. It is not what you pay in the US yet, but the number of lands and attractions is not equal yet. What is surprising to me is the hugh increase in the cost of everything overall. No longer can I bring back a shirt or eat in the park. Want a ballon, it will cost you over $20 US. Want a bag to show that you bought the few things you could afford? It too will cost you.

It was raining when we went in the 1st day and the park was empty so we managed to get on all the attractions with little to no ques at all. Day 2 was nice and sunny but still not that busy but I can imagine it being a nightmare peak season when its packed. There was only two attractions that had fast passes. There is hardly any thrill rides it is all based around much younger children. We basically did the whole park in less than a day. As we stayed at one of the Disneyland Hotels (not recommended) we popped in and out on day 2 and came back for the fireworks.The parades were spectacular as was the fireworks, but mega busy. The cost of food and drinks and souvenirs were epically over priced as usual but USD $15 for a 3in1 sachet coffee and a sachet hot chocolate was really bad! $40 for a balloon lol... best thing is take your own food and drink as backpacks are fine but they do get checked at the gate.Overall it was all about my little girl and she had a magical time.Look online for discount tickets dont buy direct as you will pay a lot more.My tip for the best experience is go when its raining as it will be heaps quieter, take your own lunch, buy souvenirs Down Town, watch the fireworks at the end of main street where you can still see them over the magin kingdom but you can leave ahead of the crowds...",Disneyland_HongKong

The app shows wait times for all attractions.Second, book a table for a restaurant in advance if you want anything beyond junk food. Towards the early evening the decent looking restaurants were fully booked.Third, getting tickets for both parks proved a mistake. After endless lines for attractions (15 45 min waits), ice cream (45 min wait), lunch (30min wait), dinner (30 min wait) we never made it even close to the second park.Our 5yo daughter loved the parade and mustered impressive patience during the visit (that was all the magic I saw).

We were not impressed with the afternoon parade, Soundsational. It was the most underwhelming Disney parade that we have ever seen and we have been to Disney World more than 9 times. The best part of the day was experiencing attractions that can not be found in Disney World. We loved the    Finding Nemo    submarine and the    The Matterhorn.    The    Indiana Jones    attraction was our favorite! We also greatly enjoyed    The Haunted Mansion.    It was great to see it themed based on    The Nightmare Before Christmas.    The    Pirates of the Caribbean    ride was really great and the wait time was short, even in the standby line. Well done, Disney! The food that we had was of good quality.

145548867,5,2012-11-01,Australia,We got a 5 day hopper and we like to sleep in so 2 hours after the parks open there are not huge lines at the gate. Also starting the rides when everyone is looking for food means the lines are shorter. Both kids 8 & 10 (tall for there age) were able to go on every ride that they wanted. Lockers for jackets as the temperature cooled down really helped.,Disneyland_California
290857472,4,2015-06-01,United Kingdom,"I visited the park with my 19 year old daughter on the 30 th June . Quite a large area of the park was closed for renovations, I was so disappointed . I am not sure why so many areas where closed at the same time, this had a huge impact on the rest of the park causing large cues. most rides had space for extra people when they left, unbelievable when the ques where so long. A singles ques for all rides would be a better option ,to avoid waisting spaces.The tea cup ride allowed 1 person per cup at times rather than put several individuals together to reduce the waiting time for the ride. I had planned to eat at the all you can eat Arabian Buffett,but the whole area was closed. Consequently I went to book a table at walts restaurant, it was closed for the day, I was so disapointed. The highlights of the day were the parade and the Disney dream show, the latter was the most amazing performance that I have ever seen, it was truly remarkable.",Disneyland_Paris
567020259,2,2018-03-01,Singapore,The Disneyland park is currently undergoing some renovation. Can be quite dusty n noisy. There were many groups from schools n it was so crowded wherever we went. Especially during meal times. No seats and we had to queue for around 45mins for food!No more fireworks since January. Ticket price should be cheaper in view of the fireworks cancellation since it's the highlight of the visit.My son's favourite antique car ride was no longer available...

224525161,4,2014-08-01,United Kingdom,"I won't rave about how magical it is   obviously it is! It's about more than just the rides, if you just want big rides you can do fine with theme parks in England, this is about the whole Disney experience!A few things I wish I had known...Wear really comfortable shoes! You will walk A LOT. Even just walking from the car park takes about 15 minutes!You probably need at least 3 days to do it all.Book restaurants in advance. But think carefully about their location   we booked a lunch at Cafe Mickey but didn't realise that it was in the Disney Village which means you have to leave the park and walk about 10 minutes, so you only really want to plan to eat in the Village at the end of your day when you are leaving as you won't want to do it in the middle of the day.The parade at 5pm ish is fab   we were actually walking to Fantasyland and happened to catch it. I recommend you walk round the the right of the Castle as you face it   the crowds are much smaller so you get a good view and the parade starts from round there so you see everything.Disney dreams is also amazing   it starts at 11pm and we got a spot at 10pm quite close to the front because we thought there would be stuff on the street to see, but we need not have bothered! Everything is projected on to the castle, so as long as you can see the castle you won't miss anything. I recommend you wait until they make the announcement 15 minute before it starts and then go find a spot   keep using the rides up until then!Figure out fastpass   it is a great way to get on a popular ride without queuing. There are lots of tips online about it so I won't go into it here.If you have Pause Gourmande vouchers, use them carefully! One our first day we got a pre wrapped brownie and pre wrapped mickey cakes, neither of which were great, and drinks from the soda fountain. On day 2 we went into one a bakery on Main Street and got amazing fresh muffins and bottles of drink   no contest!Crush's Coaster in the studios park is great but no fastpass   we went there first thing one morning (about 9.30) and queued before it opened and got on in an hour. I didn't realise that though the park opens at 10, that just means the rides start at 10   you can actually go in and walk round queue up before then. Ratatouille was too busy and no fastpass that day so we skipped that.Oh, and baby switch is also great (obviously if you have a baby with you). You ask at the entrance of each ride as they are all different, but in general one parent and the baby waits at the exit and then you just swap after the first parent child has ridden. Our 6 year old got to go on almost every ride twice which she loved!",Disneyland_Paris

571370861,5,2018-03-01,Australia,Went to Disneyland on a the Wednesday before Easter and found that the crowds were not as bad as I was expecting. The park opens at 10.00am however some of the lands within open at later times. The Disney app is worthwhile using as it has real time waiting times for the rides and attractions and also a GPS enabled map to get you around however as there are only wifi hotspots unless you have data the app will drop out when there is no wifi. Make good use of the FastPass options as this can save time in queues but remember that you can only have one pass at a time and cannot get another one until after a specified time which is on your ticket. Plenty of food options available and souvenir stores and carts are everywhere. Stay for the Disney Paint The Night Parade at the end as this is well worthwhile. Get a position at the end of Main Street and watch the parade come to you. Also lets you get out of the park as soon as the parade has ended to get to the station ahead of the crowd. There were several areas under maintenance on the day that I was there however still plenty of other things to see and do. I had a great time and would recommend kids (and adults) of all ages to go.,Disneyland_HongKong
236617136,3,2014-10-01,Canada,"I love Disneyland for my son. That being said, we went on Canadian Thanksgiving, which unbeknownst to me, is also Columbus Day in the States. With the long weekend and HalloweenTime festivities, it was fairly crowded. I would likely keep to going in January February when the park is quieter. By all accounts, it's still not as bad as it would be in the summer or at major holidays.",Disneyland_California
147813976,4,2012-12-01,Australia,"This Disneyland is small but just as exciting for little children. To see the smiles on their faces is pure magic. We bought out tickets at the hotel making entry very easy. As grandparents we were very impressed with the $100HK entry for us (a substantial concession). Adults are $399HK. We caught a taxi to and from TST and could not believe the efficiency at the end of a very long day when we walked straight up to a taxi and were whisked away immediately   no queues. We were lucky to experience the magic of Disney at Christmas time and the park was decorated beautifully. Snow falling in Main Street USA all night, huge Christmas tree and a wonderful ambience within the entire park. Food was ok, but nothing exciting and typically Disney expensive.",Disneyland_HongKong
203463680,4,2014-04-01,Philippines,Maybe our timing was wrong  we didnt know it was Spring Break when we visited; lots of people in the park. People were saving spaces with blankets 3hrs prior to Fantasmic! Fastpass to Cars (new) was gone in 2hrs of park opening. Had to wait 135minutes to ride it. The 3day parkhopper was not enough.Food was expensive and not worth it; best to eat out first. Come early or come late! Be ready to be told that rides breakdown. But I guess we'd still return  Disneyland! Fantastic shows parades and ambience. Just too many people.,Disneyland_California

93597662,4,2010-11-01,United Kingdom,"we went in an off peak season and found that the queues werent too bad if you stay on a disney park ,have your breakfast early so you can get the extra hours in the parks.the food isnt great in the parks and very overpriced,so if you can try to have a big breakfast then snack in the parks and have a meal in the evening off the park,in the downtown disney area.when you first go in the main park,take the train around the park,so you get a little barings to where the big rides are,if you have a child under 5,I would defentley recommend hiring a park buggy as its well worth the money as they get so tired of the walking all day!!!also the main show at 5pm is the same everyday so when youve watched it a couple of times this is the best time to slip off on the big attractions as there are heardly any queues!",Disneyland_Paris
251022395,5,2014-12-01,Australia,We came all the way from Australia and it did not disappoint. The kids loved meeting the characters however some of the lines were very long. The rides were as we expected and some of them had long waits as well. The Looney Tune park was the quietest part of the park with rides only a short wait. The food was a little pricey compared to everywhere else in America. There was no real option for breakfast so you would be better off eating before you arrived or at the downtown area. The park was extremely busy being just before Christmas but this didn't bother us too much.We had been anticipating a trip to Disneyland since small children and it was everything that I had envisioned.The fireworks during the night were ok however after getting a spot early we were forced by staff to stand an hour later and wait another hour for them to start and finish. No one around us seemed happy with the arrangement after we all got in early so we wouldn't have to stand. The kids complained about their feet hurting and this was the only let down of the day.,Disneyland_California
229464233,1,2014-08-01,United Kingdom,"This place is awful, no other word for it, extortionate prices, horrendous value, terrible food provision, general poor organisation, yes children love it but they do not see it for the practical issues it brings.Our visit with parking cost   243 for one day in two parks, over 12 hours in the 2 parks and 8 rides later     30 per ride, I will never complain about uk funfairs again. Queuing for 40 70 minutes for most rides, when working or fully operational is unacceptable, we waited 30 minutes for one ride, It then broke, we persisted a further 15 minutes then abandoned it. Every ride we went on had one carriage or a similar impediment to being fully operational. Staff whilst generally helpful and bilingual did not use much haste in keeping things moving. Near feral behaviour or parents of very nation, which was the most embarrassing aspect of the whole visit, did not help and queue jumping sneaking past was common place, seeing grown adults run to a ride to beat 2 children to a flying dumbo was shameful. Smoking in the park should also be banned as this was quite problematic for my pregnant wife waiting as we queued for rides dodging herds of heavy smokers crowding around rides, come on Disney, get with the 21st century and consider the Health of kids, smoking parents...unlucky. Even after rides walking to exits I had to dodge parents lighting up as soon as they stepped off. The end of the day saw diversions around the castle due to the fireworks display preparations and finding your way back in the dark was just hoping to follow the crowd and hope they knew the way, direction finding in the dark is almost impossible to the new visitor. We came across two staff indicating with cyalumes initially then no more help. Food provision whilst widespread was generally not suitable for children and again queues were just too long even outside peak times, we ended up at plaza gardens and I can comfortably say in my 46 years of travelling around the world (in the RAF) I can honestly say this was my worst dining experience ever. The international buffet was far from that, it was a mix of food that could not be known till you got in and paid. We expected a jimmy spices type experience, how wrong we were, all you can eat and drink (soft drinks) for    75 for two adults and one child was exorbitant, no other way to put it. Quite why reservations are ever made At this place I will never understand, without one we got in after 30 minutes and the buffet platter menu above the platter providing a key to the food did not match at all. We were shown by a waiter to a table and he swept off crumbs with his hand as we approached, food choice was abysmal and two serveries quickly became one, a cheese board just disappeared and the same feral parents from the rides jumped queues to grab at the fresh serving of chips as others queued to get their measly choices of gristly lamb, over cooked pasta or burnt potato gratin and we like others padded our meals out with salad that was plentiful and fresh but being avoided by most. It must be said most of the parents would have been better advised to tuck into the salads instead of the fatty food whilst the option was right in front of them. A McDonald's may have Been better, fast, known food, fair prices and better service even they do salads too. Drinks top ups were hard to secure and when surly staff could be found to do so it seemed a major inconvenience. Toilet provision for an estimated 400 seat venue amounted to; for gents, one urinal and one cubicle and an Italian man delicately squeezing his spots for some time brazenly delaying the man in front of me getting his children's hands washed after toileting, the ladies had two cubicles and stank heavily of urine and the slippery floor stains were easy to detect their origin, it seems provision of, and cleanliness of, the toilets was a side concern as both were very cramped too. Even the restaurant floors were food debris strewn beyond what could be reasonably expected, thankfully not with urine. Perhaps to be expected with the nature of many of the visitors. A request for dessert spoons...for dessert took 10 minutes to have effect. I am sure that some food outlets at eurodisney provide a fair service but my experience of plaza gardens was abysmal and it is probably not a safe, let alone enjoyable place to eat and any licensing authority reviewing it's suitability needs to assess it incognito, to see what we saw. My advice, avoid it, take all your own food, there can be little other choice.",Disneyland_Paris
212013907,2,2014-06-01,United Kingdom,"I had wanted to take my daughter to Disney for some time as she loves the Disney Princesses but didn't want to go to America just yet as she is only 4 and I know the parks in America are huge. So we decided to tag a 3 day visit to Disneyland Paris to the end of a 10 day trip to the Dordogne.This was our last opportunity to go during term time as my daughter starts school in Sept so I thought we would take advantage of term time prices   I don't think there is such a thing, or if there is I don't even want to think how much more it would cost.Considering we went in June, the cost of this trip was ridiculous, but I put that aside believing it was going to be a magical experience and it would all be worth it to see the characters and my daughters face when she met a princess. To put it in perspective it cost us significantly more to spend 3 days in self catering accommodation at Disney (Davy Crockett Ranch) than it did for 10 days in the Dordogne. And it doesn't stop there, inside the park the cost of food drink is extortionate, gifts, balloons, etc are all sooo expensive   Face painting was 12 euros! I never imagined it would be cheap and I was glad we had a half board meal plan which included an afternoon snack. The queues for rides weren't too bad but the rides for younger children are pretty poor in my opinion. I got increasingly fed up with being barged and jostled by rude adults and unruly kids. I dread to think what it would be like in school holiday time. By far, the biggest disappointment for us was the lack of characters. Sure, we saw the daily parade twice and that was lovely but its not the same as getting an autograph and your photo taken with a character. We queued for 2.5 hrs to get a ticket for an 'audience with a princess' then queued for approx 1.5 hrs to actually see the princess   which lasted a minute at most. My daughters face was one of awe and she loved meeting Cinderella, even if only for a minute.We then queued for over 2 hrs to meet Micky Mouse   again lasted less than a minute. We saw a queue to meet Rapunzel and I made a decision not to queue any more as it was enormous.The advertising leads you to believe there will be characters galore to have your picture taken with but this was most definitely not the case for us. Maybe we were just incredibly unlucky but we were there for 3 days from early in the morning till gone 9pm (and later one night). The parades were good but make sure you secure a spot an hour before it starts and guard it well!The firework and light show at park closing time was amazing though spoiled by people holding up cameras phones to record it so it was difficult to actually watch.Overall my daughter enjoyed it, but I think she would have been equally happy somewhere like Alton Towers or Drayton Manor which would have cost a fraction of the amount.I sound like a right tight fisted moaner   I'm really not. I've just had my magical rose tinted Disney glasses shattered and I feel quite sad that it wasn't more memorable for my daughter. Anyone who asks her what the best bit of her holiday was, she says the swimming pool; says it all really.",Disneyland_Paris
126884669,4,2011-12-01,Singapore,"Our first time to Disneyland. Although many people commented that it is small but we did not manage to complete all the rides which we intend to play in one day due to the queue.We went in early December and the weather is good. Cool and no rain at all. As we arrive at 1.30pm, we didn't managed to cover the whole park and by 6.30pm the sky was alreadly dark and we couldn't cover the Adventure land as it was totally dark.My advise to all is that:1. Reach there as early as possible in order to cover all park rides. Skip those common rides, don't waste time on them such as Merry go round, jumbo elephant and etc.2. Secure a good place for the disney parade. Beware of the China tourists, they just do not know what is basic manners, they will just squeeze their way through and even purposely stand infront of you and block your view even though they know you came first.3. Stay for the fireworks. Must use tripod and set to fireworks mode for fireworks phototaking. I didn't do that and all fireworks images were blur. 4. Try to cover Adventureland first as most of the rides are outdoor. By evening, you can't see anything.",Disneyland_HongKong

There were 2 restaurants and between 08:30 1000 there were long queues.Did not see one disney character in the hotel which was suppose to be the case, luckily my 12 year old daughter was more interested in the rides.The swimming pool was lovely (bit cold) was very deep did have 2 more pools one jacuzzi size with bubbles and another paddling pool, there were life guards on duty but would still be very wary if taking young children as I'm 5 10 and was on tip toes every part of the pool.Ate at the restaurant the all you can eat Buffet, was very expensive and didn't include drinks.2 years ago we we stayed Disney, same time of year and the Christmas Parade were much longer more of a production snow effects etc etc with all the characters and would go on for at least 30 mins. This time the Parades were a lot smaller not all characters very very disappointed, 10 mins but will change I should imagine.The stunt show was also cut short missing the massive explosive finale of 2 years ago, again very disappointed.The laser show on the Castle at 19:00hrs daily was amazing we were waiting an hour before for a good view and it was well worth the wait.We went wed sat first couple days were lovely not too busy, but towards the weekend it was manic.The timings of the parks are 10:00hrs to 19:00hrs when we were there so it felt like we were losing a lot of park time which our holiday rep never disclosed, but they are now open until 22:00hrs when we left.On the whole we had a lovely time but felt there were a lot of cutting corners cost saving etc etcAnd we also travelled by euro star which was really good and would recommend if like my daughter don't like flying.

Queues were excessively long but Fast Pass always helps and that really works! Watched the fireworks at 9.30pm which was great and then there was another show at 10.30pm by the lake and that was also fantastic.

143249118,4,2012-10-01,United States,"Just got back from a day at Disneyland and was surprised and thrilled to see the Star Tours ride had been significantly improved! Now instead of just one experience there are several. We went on the ride three times and each one was different. If you love Star Tours you will REALLY love it now!! Fun!Was very fun to see the park all decorated for Halloween    especially the Haunted House. They had totally redecorated inside and went with the Nightmare before Christmas theme. Very cool! Even Space Mountain had a Halloween theme. Disneyland is always fun, but this time of year is especially awesome! They also had a special area with live animals and great decorations!Only negative . . . the park was only open from 9   8:00 pm, but we paid the regular going admission that is charged on days when the park is open much longer. Seems like they should charge less if the park isn;t open as long. The best food deal we found was at Rancho Del Zocolo over by Thunder Mountain. They have a Burrito that comes with rice, beans, sour cream and guar that is huge for $10.99. My husband and I actually split it and had plenty to eat! Definitely the best deal at the park!!",Disneyland_California
116492859,4,2011-08-01,United Kingdom,"Stayed at Newport Bay Hotel having travelled Eurostar. Train & booking in at Ebbsfleet all went well as did the parking at Ebbsfleet. At Eurodisney, you drop your cases in at a 'depot' and set off to Disneyland without a care. Your cases are actually delivered to your room. You book in to the hotel after your day in Disney   wonderful.We stayed 2 nights H B. You get about 21 euro credit at the restaurants per adult if you don't select from the set menu. We often had bits of set then 'extras' including alcoholic drinks and generally paid about 30 euro on top. Food is very good. The garlic bread in Mickeys cafe was the size and shape of a pizza! Consider going without a starter, especially if on a budget. You do get drinking cups for the children in Mickey's cafe & whilst there, the children met lots of characters. We took lots of drinks and snacks which was a good idea as the drinks (coke, water etc.) were around 2.50 euro each.Breakfast in the hotel was good really and you could bag a few rolls and various fillings at breakfast for your lunch! Work out your 'fastpass' so that you get on your favourite rides. I had no idea what rides to go on & we didn't plan properly.

Ok it was August so it was going to be busy, but it was way too over crowded. Even walking round was a nightmare   there were just too many people admitted! Queues were long and boring. No attempt to keep kids entertained   what about video screens in the queuing area showing Disney films? The number of parents I heard having to keep arguing bored kids apart while waiting for rides   it made me feel relieved it wasn't just mine! Yes, we did Fast Pass, but as you get a time slot a couple of hours in advance and can only hold one at a time, it doesn't really help. The rides are great. The night time firework display was impressive. However the only characters we saw in a full 13 hour visit were in the tea time parade   where are the roaming ones from the glossy tv ads? Apparently to meet them you need to queue in a two hour meet and greet venue. Food of course is hugely overpriced and of poor quality, but that was only to be expected from a captive audience.I'd say we enjoyed the Studios more and the motor stunt show was well worth seeing.

I find the map provided after the ticketing are a great and it actually is helpful when you are trying to locate meet and greet areas. I found the scenery and set up of each park area absolutely amazing. My favs would have to be the fantasy and the adventure lands. Be warned though I brought my park tickets via travel republic and was not able to scan my printed tickets at the gate. What the tickets don't say is you'll have to wait in a ticketing que before you get to the entrance turnstiles. Once our printed tickets were swapped out we were good to go!

Go rides, tasty snacks, yummy meals, ice creams, fantastic shows and more await you. The park opens at around 10:30 a.m. and closes at 8 p.m. Plan your day well so you can cover all the shows and as many rides. Carry the park map with you and you can also download the app on your smart phone. The shows are fantabulous. You have to see all especially the  Lion King  which was playing when we were there.",Disneyland_HongKong

540679560,5,2017-11-01,United Kingdom,"The park was very magical and there's so much to do! It was brilliant. The ques for rides and attractions were short and it was a very nice experience. There isn't a great deal for very young children under about the age of 4 and pushchairs aren't allowed in many of the attractions so unless your child is a good walker, will stand in lines and be fine out of a pushchair for a while then I'd say not to bother taking them until they're older or you won't be able to do much. The park is very confusing if it's your first trip and you can easily get lost, it took us about two days to be familiar with everything and by then the trip was over! There is hardly any signs anywhere to direct you and asking staff seems a waste of time as they mostly send you the wrong way and you just keep getting lost! There are virtually no exit signs so you can't find your way out of the park and when you do get to the exit part you can't work out which exit you actually need as there are so many with no signs! There is a serious lack of toilets in the park and no resteraunts have toilets which seems incredibly stupid, so make sure you look for a toilet at least half an hour before you actually need to go lol. The food and drinks are very expensive here. If you want to meet lots of characters your best option is to book breakfast with the characters at your hotel which is in the park, you can use your breakfast vouchers and then pay the difference (18 euros per person) when you book at your hotel reception you tell them what time you want it for and you go to the park and go to the resteraunt named on your receipt and you sit and have breakfast, the characters come round to every table and do photos and autograph signing so if you want to avoid waiting in the lines for characters around the park I'd advise pay the 18 euros to do all the character stuff comfortably in the space of like an hour then spend the rest of the day doing rides etc. We saw tigger, eeyore, piglet, Daisy Duck, Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse at breakfast which is a lot to say you have to que for about 40 minutes per character around the park. Overall it was lovely but you need a good few days excluding your travelling days to be able to get around everything.",Disneyland_Paris

We are planning another visit soon. We had a really good time. The park was clean, the staff friendly and the crowds were pretty light. I can't think of anything we didn't like. Truly.

202088615,2,2014-04-01,United States,"I have been to Disneyland and Disneyworld several times. It used to be that Disneylands charm and simplicity kept it somewhat competitive with its larger, Florida based cousin. Now, its not even close. Disneyworld seems to have an endless budget to help your kids get lost in the fantasy...especially characters dressed up everywhere. At Disneyland, we only saw two characters the entire day. The biggest difference is that because 'Land is in the middle of the same 20 million people every day, its not just a target destination for traveling families, but  frequent fliers  who are no where near as polite. At allmost every line someone would cut in front, and the employees just watched. It was very upsetting to have your toddlers and children patiently wait 40 minutes, then have to watch (typically locals) people just step in front at the last second. If you say anything, you make a scene if front of your kids. If you dont, you are not a good role model. I didnt pay several hundreds of dollars to have to deal with that...the employees should. As your kids get older, Disney overall isnt as much fun. There are only a couple of  thrill  rides, as compared to other amusement parks which have several.Having said all of that, the park is clean and the kids had a good time.",Disneyland_California

To avoid the long line of purchasing tickets, I bought it in advance.I went there on Monday as to avoid the crowd. Unfortunately, many tourists were there. Of course, long lines were seen in front of all attractions. Average of 30 40 minutes of waiting time. The management should look into this (for your information, Universal Studio Singapore waiting time for an attraction is about 15 20 minutes during weekends).We were having our lunch at about 3.30pm. Yet you have to spend 30 minutes to buy our meals.It was raining on and off on that day. We were not able to enjoy as much as we wish to because there was a small baby with us.Tips: bring your rain coat.Overall, my experience was pleasant especially my children were happy inside the park. Honestly, not much of changes updates in term of attractions. Visitors (especially myself) may consider to visit the other theme park after several visits of the almost similar attractions.

It's not cheap but I recommend to get at least a 2 day pass so it will be enjoyable for the whole family. Better to save money for several months then go and enjoy the parks instead of trying to do everything in one day. As a warning, it's a very crowded theme park but a lot of fun.

The park is immaculate, amazingly clean considering the amount of visitors every day. Everyone is happy in Disneyland!The 2 hours early pass you get when staying in Disney Hotels is brilliant as you can literally walk on most rides and no queue (although not all rides are open during this time).Highlights for us   Dreams show, Peter Pan ride, Pirates of the Caribbean & Buzz Lightyears Laser Quest!I would also recommend watching all the parades and head to the train when you need a little rest, a great way to entertain the kids whilst resting upWe can't wait for our next trip!",Disneyland_Paris
448567494,4,2016-12-01,United Kingdom,"We stayed 22 nd Dec to 27 th this year. Was truly amazing as we found out where & when all the parades, shows, fireworks were on. So we saw & did everything we wanted to. Go an hour before parades to get a front row seat. 2 hours for the firework display. Wrap up warm & get some ponchos. Be warned you will go from one queue to another whether it's for a ride or food. I'm sorry to say but the French don't queue, lack manners & aren't as friendly as the English. My 9year old was pushed from the front of the Peter Pan ride by a woman. Then a few times after with people barging past. Disgusting behaviour. We had dinner at Mickey Cafe which was lovely as we saw Mickey & friends & didn't have to queue 2 hours for each one. If you can afford it's 60 euros to get fast passes to meet the Disney characters which will save you so much time. You can queue at 9 to get in to Thunder Mountain which opens at 10. We found this was best to do first thing as queues later in the day were 2 hours. Take plenty of snacks & drinks. So expensive in the park. You can't take glass or selfie sticks in.

They don t use the technology available today to create magic, as Walt used to do in the past. A forever gone era it seems.

208869735,5,2013-10-01,United Kingdom,"I absolutely loved Disneyland Paris. We were apprehensive as had read some reviews saying that is was drab and didn't have the same feel to it as the US Disney World. However, it is a beautiful place and although compared to America it is small it is still an amazing experience.Even my husband absolutely loved Disneyland Paris and keeps suggesting a return trip. It is magical and almost feels as though you are in a different world. It is spotlessly clean unlike any theme parks in the UK and the range of rides is also impressive as most theme parks despite claims that they are 'family friendly' have very very few rides for young children. The food is very overpriced however you go to Disneyland expecting this I suppose as you expect this at most family theme parks. The rides, parades, shows etc are all wonderful.Tips:Walt Disney Studios have more organised meet and greets that you can que for (roughly 20 mins) as some people are very rude when the characters are just wandering around and do not wait nicely and shove their children forward to meet characters.If you're eating at McDonalds which gets VERY busy the perfect time is around 4 5. They still have everything in stock at this time and it isn't as hectic. Also, make sure you're in a proper queue and the locals are very rude to any tourists and shove you out of the way if you are accidentally between queues. Definitely watch all of the parades especially Disney Dreams as it is an amazing experience.",Disneyland_Paris

549396071,4,2017-12-01,Canada,"Was pretty and festive to be at Disneyland the week of a Christmas but we were sadly disappointed that Disney clearly oversold tickets. After 12 noon, it   s a human side by side shuffle to get anywhere and you must buy a fast pass to get on more than a few rides in a 10 hour Period. After fireworks, they don   t let you leave out the way you came in, they shuffle you behind the scenes almost like cattle. It actually was a bit scary. If anyone tripped or anything happened I could totally see folks getting squished trampled. I cannot imagine that Walt Disney would have stood for this.

If I am being generous I would say the rooms are in character; however, if I had turned up at a hotel in Spain on a costas holiday and they had attempted to shoehorn us into that room I would have complained. Breakfast is buns, cheese and ham. The evening meals are buffet style (  24 head) but are excellent quality   the cod in butter sauce is to die for. There are two parks, Disney Studios (more technical in nature) and Disneyland Parcs which is the cartoon fest. Great fun, plenty of walking so bring your best walking shoes and loads of queing (oodles of patience required). Very expensive to buy food, drink and goods. Couple of big tips, buy your Disney Princess dresses in the UK from Asda and take them with you, it will cost you   50 per dress to buy them on site. Similarly, go to the shops and vending machines in the train station beside the parks for your food and drink and take it in with you   it will save you a fortune. 5 days are too long, we had to break up our visit by taking the train into Paris.",Disneyland_Paris

176824970,5,2013-04-01,United States,"Disneyland Resort ReviewWho doesn't enjoy Disney movies? That's right, nobody. Everybody loves Disney movies, I mean what is there not to love right? All these classic movies about princesses, princes, frogs, talking cars, living toys with exciting adventures, bugs, monkey men, pirates, fairies, superheroes, monsters and almost everything imaginable put into a great story! They're simply un resistable! My own favorite Disney movie for instance is probably Tangled. It's about rapunzel and this boy she meets and everything and same as all Disney movies, makes me laugh the whole time and just about all these Disney movies just make you happy inside, although I've heard teenage women enjoy considering them chick flicks instead and would rather cry their hearts out alone with a bucket of ice cream, but they still feel that happiness inside of them from the story told in these movies.Now, these Disney movies are great, everybody loves them and can make almost anybody happy, but what could be better than that? What could make you even happier? These are the questions I believe they were asking when they created the happiest place on earth. A place that everyone's heard about and most people have visited this wonderland, but for some it is a new experience. For me, I have been here before but I was too young to remember or actually enjoy myself there. Well, by now you should know that the only place I could possibly be talking about that is just the center happy of and fun and also known as the happiest place on earth. Disneyland! Where dreams come true!This previous summer I was able to visit this fun filled resort with my family and believe it or not I was not too excited to go because all I could think was that I was too old for this place. Disneyland is meant for little kids and I'm just going to be bored the entire time. Well that was one of the most un true things I have ever thought, or I guess you could say, thunk. I arrived early the first morning to the front gates of Disneyland and anxiously waited for my turn to enter the amusement park. I walked in surprised on how they had made this entire park, everything in it, everything about it, just look happy. You look around and you don't see the same kind of buildings that you see here in eagle mountain. Oh no, now you're in Disneyland, now you are in toon town. The people are dressed differently with smiles on their faces and their funky colorful clothing standing out amongst millions of people from all around the globe here to witness the wonder. Everything is decorated with happiness. Music playing everywhere you go, your favorite Disney characters surrounding the streets, and more rides than anywhere I've ever been! I spent about a week in DIsneyland and I had the best time of my life there, and yes, I was 16, not 4, and I enjoyed it a ton. When I left that place I was surprised how downed I was trying to get used to normal life compared to how happy DIsneyland made me feel. The whole place just enlightens your mood. Ever need a break and need to forget about the world? Disneyland is definately the best choice you could possibly make.",Disneyland_California

The longer you stay the easier and more pleasurable the Disneyland Paris can be.Me and my girlfriend stayed in the New York hotel from Monday to Friday we went on the all the rides we wanted to go on the Monday and Tuesday when it was slightly quieter.From Wednesday it got really busy with some rides especially in Walt Disney studios queuing for 3 hours.In Disneyland Park its easier to get on the rides to due to the magic hours(some of the big rides don't open in these hours but you can be first in line) and it gets quieter after 6pm.Walt Disney studios is a different story due to no magic hours and closing at 6pm which is baffling, you should visit this park at the start of the week, the 2 best rides are here as well, Crushs coaster and Ratouille.We did not use the Fastpass system even though we were residents because we had no need to and once it got really busy was pointless as you still ended up queuing for at least an hour though I suppose better than 3 hours.Service can be slow queuing for food but slow service seems common in Paris.The Parades and the Disney Dreams display at the end of the day are wonderful to watch.Buffalo bills Wild west show is a must.Enchanted Forest show is a must.We did not have a meal plan as I wanted a choice of meals, now Ive been I might take advantage next time as I know what's there.Me and my girlfriend had a fabulous time and would go again in a heartbeat, there are several rides closed that I would like to experience.I would recommend staying in the Park for convenience and the use of the magic hours.I spent    400 altogether, don't expect to save money.Despite some minor gripes it was a wonderful experience, I would definitely recommend Disneyland Paris to all.",Disneyland_Paris

The park opened at 1030am, but somem of the areas did not open until 11am, so you need to listed and plan accordingly. The grizzley Gulch coaster and the  haunted mansion   not really haunted but really cool   are a must see. Winnie pooh and Buzz were closed so that was a little disappointing. The simulator on Iron Man is a must do as well. The Space Mountain was redone to now have scenery that is like you are in Star Wars jet shooting at the Empire. Best Space Mtn ride of all of them. Its a Small World was even a little better as the scenary is different and includes Disney Princesses in each set, which is fun to find for the kids. Go early as there are multiple line checks to get in. Buy tickets ahead of time as 2 3 of the people that went thru security stopped to get tickets there.",Disneyland_HongKong
433388370,2,2015-11-01,United States,"Disneyland used to be a place where everyone could afford to go and have a good time. In recent years the park has gotten so overcrowded that you can wait upwards of 4 hours to get on 1 single ride. They keep raising the ticket prices saying they offer a good value for your money, which is not true. Most of the time you can't even get on the ride of your choice. They raise the food prices it seems every 3 4 months. Not a fun place to visit anymore and Disney has priced me out of future visits.",Disneyland_California

I love Disneyland's friendly and helpful  cast members , the cleanliness, the music, the fun. The Disneyland website is great for making dining reservations. I love the dinner that allows me to sit front row to see Fantasmic. It is all so fun, and I am so grateful for my Annual Pass.",Disneyland_California
365898247,5,2016-04-01,United States,"The best rides at Disneyland: 1) Star Tours (FP), 2) Hyperspace Mountain (FP), 3) Finding Nemo, 4) It's A Small World, 5) Indiana Jones Adventure (FP), 6) Pirates of the Caribbean, 7) Haunted House (FP), 8) Peter Pan's FlightAt night, at around 7pm, make sure you save a spot along Main Street to watch the breathtaking light show  Paint the Night  and fireworks. The music coupled with the show made the whole Disney experience magical and memorable.Just like my other review of Disney California, my tips are:Tips:1) Make sure you get there early when the park opens. 2) Use fastpass for popular rides like Star Tours, Indiana Jones Adventures, etc.",Disneyland_California
120281308,3,2011-10-01,United Kingdom,"I went with my mum, sister, 6 year old daughter and 4 year old nephew. Altho the kids enjoyed themselves while in the park on the rides, even going in October it was still busy (some rides over an hour and a half wait)The euro is pretty much the same as the pound at the moment so everything to me was well overpriced. My daughter got the tangled dress from the disney store in the uk and it was   30, in paris it was   60. The food was proberly the worst thing for me and again overpriced. Most places to eat were like 'fast food' places and very expensive. We went to a buffet place one night and for 3 adults and 2 children (including 1 soft drink each) it came to just under   100. And lastly....the studio park closes at 6pm and the main park at 7pm after this there is nothing to do except eat and shop with the exception of the show or cinema.I wont be going back.....",Disneyland_Paris
524332802,2,2017-09-01,United States,"Dear all,Let me make the process clear. If u r in receipt of PIP DLA or have an access card Disability rail card you CAN get a carer ticket in for free BUT.1. Buy your full price ticket online first about    392. Take that ticket to the disabled ticket stall on left hand side with yr disabled railcard or PIP letter etc amd THEN you will get a free carer pass.DO NOT follow the rubbish guidance on disney site as yesterday we got stung for    72 euro entry for 1 plus a free carer as we bought at the gate.NOW   take your tickets to CITY HALL and ask for a special disabled.pass. This allows you fast access to all.the rides via the exit, with hardly any standing or waiting. This is a family ticket so you can all get quick entry. This is a SPECIAL pass NOT a fast pass which u have to pay for. The SPECIAL pass is free.Note: the carpark is    20. Yes I said it correctly. Head to Disneyland Hotel. Show your disability parking permit when u purchase your car.park ticket, they will give u a ticket with a code on for disability parking which is a stones throw from the park.Extra note: if it is raining the disney.characters dont come out and light parades cancelled and rides shut. They don't care at all and it does not feel very disney at all. Don't go in the rain.Cheeseburger was    22!! Yep. But found pizza place that does a Royale Pizza, side salad big coke and fruit salad. This is    15 for the deal but we thought it would feed to adults. As if u stay.in park until close u r gonna have to eat twice really.Money saving tip:  when u go and see Mickey for a formal.pic, they will take a picture using yr.mobile if u ask or alternatively like any photo taken on a ride you can take a picture of it with yr phone for FREE and is just as good.Its a money grabbing pit. The toilets were diagusting and I mean disgusting. Can not believe this was such an expensive park. I have visited eurodisney when it.opened 25 years ago, on 15th anni.amd yesterday. It has NOT.changed at.all from 25 years ago. There r hardly any signposts which annoyed me. There is another park which you.can pay an additional    5 for. If u have been before to original park I would recommend the new one. Will i go again? Im 45 now so probably not. The rides etc r so much better at Alton Towers or Chessington. With no disney.characters around and rain we should have stayed at home.",Disneyland_Paris
118159496,2,2011-09-01,India,"Had heard a lot about this place and unfortunately did not read reviews about this place on trip advisor and my travel agent Kuoni travels claimed that this attraction is worth going to. For travellers from India, if one has been to Wonderla at the outskirts in Bangalore Disneyland is not even 10% of what Wonderla has to offer. Disneyland Paris has very limited rides and the waiting time for most of the rides is 40 60 mins. The rides are all of the same nature, the park is divided into two Parks and I must say both Parks are just a way to earn money. I would rather have spent a day in Paris and spent time in visiting the beautiful museums rather than wasting time at the parks which have nothing much to offer. Travel from Paris to Disneyland and back in a cab is about 200 euros. This is complete waste of time, energy and money and I would advice fellow travellers to carefully plan the visit before going to the parks.",Disneyland_Paris
323444911,5,2015-10-01,United Kingdom,Immaculate and well laid out.Be prepared for a lot walking and queuing.The evening light and firework display by the castle is out of this world.The parades of the characters and dancers twice a day is a must too.Plenty of places to eat or drink .No litter !,Disneyland_Paris
396567398,4,2016-07-01,United States,"We are from the east coast, so we visit Disney World every year. This was our first trip to Disneyland. It was different, but still fun. Pros: The park is way smaller. So you can get around the park faster. It is very easy to knock out this park in 1 day if you plan it right. The nighttime parade was awesome. Don't miss it! They really do a great job with it and it's fun to watch.Hyperspace mountain! Star Wars has taken over Space Mountain in the best possible way. Even if you aren't a Star Wars fan, you will enjoy this version of the old ride. If you can't view fireworks from the castle, check them out by Small World. The images from the castle are shown on this building and the fireworks are right overhead. Cons:The park is small, so it feel way more crowded.When they do the parade, it feels like half of the park is not available because it is all roped off. Extra magic hours are usually great, but here they only open up tomorrow land and fantasyland. We didn't know that going in and were kinda disappointed since we were hoping to knock out adventure land first. Not a huge deal, but good to know in advance so you can plan accordingly. Overall, we enjoyed it. It's the original. But we are too spoiled by Disney World.",Disneyland_California
235799086,4,2014-10-01,United States,"Loved our visit!I was disappointed that Elsa and Anna tickets were already gone at 10am, because of the Magic Morning Hour. For those of you planning a trip, you need to get a virtual standby pass (like FastPass) for Elsa and Anna. It can be a little bit of a mob scene to get these. When the park opens they try to make everyone  slowly  walk over to Elsa and Anna's area in Fantasyland to begin getting the virtual tickets. You are able to see Olaf onto of the roof. If you stand to the right of the line and look at Olaf, if you look straight into the  house  (greeting meeting) area you'll usually be able to see Elsa and Anna. However, if your kid is too young to understand they can't run into the room to say hi and they can't meet them that day at anytime      don't do this. Hit the Frozen pre parade instead. Which you need to grab a seat an hour prior to the pre parade on the curb and stand your ground. People plead and beg to let your kid smooth into a seat next to your family   ..sorry, lady my kids and I have waited over an hour so they could  comfortable  sit on the curb to see Elsa and Anna, and all the other Disney Characters   ..not happening. :) Not trying to be mean   .just saying.But Disney is Disney. Its wonderful, clean, magical   hit the pre parade to see Anna and Elsa ride by on a float. And don't get your hopes up for the meet and greet, but if you get one   LUCKY! :)Best place to eat: Plaza Inn (end of Main Street): about $16 a meal, but good about of food and decent tasting for amusement park food. Air Conditioned and nice sit down, buffet styled restaurant. Don't forget to leave a couple bucks tip for the bussers. Also they have togo containers for all the food you didn't finish. Save some money and eat the rest in line later. We always do. People eat in line all the time. Don't knock it. An hour long wait with the same people in front and behind you can get old sometimes, especially when they are eating turkey legs from Frontier Adventureland and your hungry.Bathroom for women usually without a long wait:the bathroom right behind the Plaza or in California Adventure in A Bugs Life world.Best hotel (value price): Paradise pier is the cheapest and nice enough for Disney. As a disney hotel guest tho, you are allowed to use met amenities at all 3 Disney hotels. So go visit Grand Californian or Schedule a Character breakfast at the Disneyland Hotel. However, Only Paradise Pier guarantees Mickey to show up for breakfast. Walk over to the Disneyland Hotel and take the monorail over to Disneyland for Magic Morning Opening instead of walking. Free, nice, enjoyable, first ride of the day! :)Fireworks: If you like the fireworks, but aren't dead set on them   head over to Thunder Mountain Railroad and ride the ride. You can see the fireworks as you go in and out of the tunnels and adds to the excitement of the ride   ..PLUS, no waiting!!! You can't see the fireworks all that great in Frontierland, so its pretty empty. I can usually ride it about 4 5 times in a row before a line begins to form again (they make you get out and go all the way around again and then get back on the ride. Just policy). Also Fantasyland is closed a little prior and during fireworks, because of the fireworks. :) Make sure you don't schedule to hit Fantasyland that time, as its not open at that time.The infamous Dolewhip: If you haven't heard of this, then you will be curious as to why there is a line wrapping down Adventureland that people wait 15  plus for this little (permanent) stand to sell them Pinneapple juice with Pineapple Icecream (Dolewhip Float)   .because 1, its only found in Disney (that I a SoCal resident know of) and 2, its amazing! Heres a hint   .skip the wait on the outside. Go into the Tiki room area (you'll want to see the show anyway) and hit the line on the inside. Sooo much faster! Plus you might be able to find a seat in the waiting area there to sit down and just have 1 person stand in line (they have cup holders, you just need to ask for it).Fast Passes: You can hold more then one at a time per ticket passholder at a time 2 ways.1:You can hold a fast pass at CA Adventure for a ride like Screamin over Ca and then head over to Disney and get a fast pass for Space mountain. The parks are on separate systems.2:Say its noon. You get a fast pass for Big Thunder (becuz you really like Fireworks and don't want to take my advice). its for 1:15 2:15pm. At 2:15pm you Fastpass releases and you can grab one for Star Tours. If thats 4:30 5:30pm, you can grab another pass at 5:30pm for another ride.Passes DO NOT EXPIRE! I don't care what the ticket says, go to the ride whenever you can want. Disney cast members don't want to upset guests and hardly ever say anything. The worst you get is a slight scold from a cast member (who should never do that by the way) and then they shrug anklet you in reminding you to be careful of times. Stuff happens   your eating, your across in Critter country and stuck in a long line for Splash Mountain   .just apologize and go in.This has only happened to me twice on far separate different occasions, but usually by a seemingly 18 year old, new employee that turns around to the Senior lead and then lets you enter. Someone just following the rules a little to strictly because its probably their first job and they are new. The customer IS Always right in Disneyland. :)So try to plan your day, but just try to enjoy yourself. We knew going it would be hard to get an Anna Elsa pass on a Magic Morning Day but we are passholders and my daughter will get to meet them at some point. :) It didn't ruin our day and we enjoyed the happiest place on earth for my daughters first time   .and definitely not the last. :) Premium Annual Passholder for the Second time",Disneyland_California

It was fun roller coster ride and worthy game. From Marvel hero, Buzz Lightyear ride, winnie the pooh, Tarzan and more disney related. Few places still under construction.

If your at a Disney hotel line they have the ticket booth right in the hotel lobby. You can use it all day back and forth only stops at the shuttleStops no where else and they have a great setup for drop offs all numbered on post drop off close to the security gates Once at the security gates all pack sac purses bags are checked very carefully down to the bottom. If you have knee or hip replacement the scanner will beep and will be patted down. If you need lockers in the left side of security or wheel chair and shooters on your right. They open only at 8 so if your going for the extra early morning you have to either comeBack or wait at wheelchair place. $50 American plus $20 deposit that is returned . It   s worth it if you need to protect your legs. Lots lots of walking and waiting also if you want to leave the park you can just bring it back to them and they will put ahold on it. We left for two hours and returned to get it no problems.Then the gates to either California or Disney park one is on the left the other on the right. Get a park hopper and you can go back and forth all dayGet a fast pass you can get a free one by going to the rides that offer it and scan your ticket for later timed ride or pay $15 a day and do it al on your phone on the Disney app. Fast pass allows you to skip very long line ups. At least 3 4 less wait.  we found so much to learn. If your Canadian you can go buy your Disney cash cards in different denominations we did $250x2 Cards so they take off the money difference and give you your balance every purchase the card is good for all in Disney orCalifornia park. The restaurants are great prices and really good fast foods. We had breakfast at one ace it was awesome great service and very reasonable. We tried IHOP one morning and it   s over priced. Stay in the parkMust see the colour waterShow awesome. The cars ride. The soaring tide. The kids rides in small world all good. Pirates of the Caribbean and raiders of the lost ark.

When we went behind the scenes, the cast members were very rude to us, and to be honest, treated us like garbage. After we had finished our parade, (Which we technically paid disney for us to do in the form of park tickets) we had to walk from behind space mountain to the back of toon town, all while we were burning up in our thick uniforms in the spring heat. Meanwhile, about four empty trams passed by us going the same direction. The only thing we got from being free entertainment for Disney was a super cheap generic Chinese made 3   cinch bag. Keep in mind that we paid Disney to entertain their guests, which they, in return, gave us some cheap disney branded crap and 4 miles of walking in our uniforms.",Disneyland_California

Some of the really good ride was  closed for refurbishment . This included the Matterhorn, Grizzly, Railroad, Mark Twain's paddle boat ride. On the plus side they brought back the Electric Parade. Haven't seen that in years. The Frozen show was worth the wait. It was definitely a hoot for everyone young and old. The food was great especially the corn dogs! We were disappointed with the Terrace Italian restaurant. When we approached for dinner they advised we should book ahead. I asked how would we know to book ahead we were tourists!

130993091,5,2012-05-01,Singapore,"This was my first trip to a Disneyland but we really went for our two year old son. Loved how clean it was and how there were so many friendly staff, who also hand out stickers to the kids. We went on a week day, so the queues were very short especially in the morning (we got there around 11am I think). There were lots of rides our little boy could enjoy (he is a bit of a thrill seeker though) which was the main thing I was wondering about before we went.We didn't buy tickets beforehand, but I think we got lucky as didn't have to queue at all to buy them from the booth there. Probably should have done that as I'm sure the queues to get in would get significant. We took the MTR there and the Disneyland Express, which was cute with it's Mickey Mouse shaped windows and plush seats, but more importantly it was very easy and cheap, and didn't take too long (around half an hour from Kowloon).Use the Fast pass if possible for the busy rides   as you feel pretty clever when come back and skip the queue. I was amazed at all the extra space allocated for the queues (which was empty when we went) so was really glad that we only once had to wait for more than 10 mins all day. I'd say if you went on a busy day the queues would turn it into a very long day especially for the kids.We took our own stroller, which you have to leave outside before you queue up. I don't mind this as not a flash one (obviously take everything out of it), but if you are worried you might be better to hire a stroller there. The strollers you can hire looked pretty good as they are big, rugged ones so would be great to hire even for a five year old (or older) if you think they will get tired.The best part of our day was when our little boy got to meet his heroes from Toy Story. What a priceless reaction   he was so excited and happy. The obliging staff took lots of photos on our own camera too so we can show him in years to come. The food was expensive, but you expect that from a Theme Park. You do get all your bags searched upon entering too, as not able to take in your own food. However with our toddler they were fine with his own food, snacks, and bottles. Surprisingly the toys were quite a bit cheaper than we thought they would be, so our lucky boy ended up with both a Woody and a Jessie toy. The only thing we didn't do was stay until the fireworks at the very end. This was a shame however we figured the train would get pretty busy as soon as they were over, and it would make it a very long day for a little boy. We didn't want to push our luck and ruin a brilliant day by a tantrum on a busy train! Overall a great time which made some brilliant family memories.",Disneyland_HongKong

658941446,5,2019-03-01,United States,"First of all, I have to mention that I always use a crowd predictor calendar to plan my visits and will not go to the park when the crowds are expected to be high because it's not fun waiting in line all day. My family prefers to wait less than 20 minutes for rides. This is doable if you go on a slow day and utilize fast passes and single rider lines. We last visited in March close to spring break and the lines were a bit longer than we usually like, but went anyway since we were meeting friends. The line for the Matterhorn was 90 min but I was able to ride it twice in 10 minutes thanks to the single rider line. Disney has stepped up their food game lately and it shows! The Food and Wine festival at DCA is nothing compared to what is offered at Epcot in Florida, but it's nice trying different items. The new Tropical Hideaway next to the Tiki Room is very well done and the treats are excellent. I appreciate seeing more vegetarian and vegan options throughout the park. I would LOVE to see Disney stop using artificial food colors in their foods; more organic options would be nice.",Disneyland_California

Planning will help minimize your steps as well. * WORLD OF COLOR : Must get tickets (no extra cost for this show) early for this event to get good viewing. They are usually gone by noon. This is amazing, definitely a do not miss in my opinion. Get there about an hour early even if you do have tickets. *Many rides have single rider line options, getting you through more quickly. I actually never got separated from my party using these lines. If it's super busy, the single rider line isn't that awesome. *The Cars ride is not just for little kids...it's fun for the whole family *If you WANT to ride the Cars ride, you must get your fast pass for this very early. They are usually all gone 2 hours after opening. HOWEVER   there is a single rider option line that can also get you through alot more quickly if you don't mind the possibility of being separated from your party.   My husband and I took our younger 2 kids to Disneyland for the first time. We both kinda thought we would just be kinda bored, and it was just something to get checked off on the list of things your kids want to do. However, it was AMAZING and we LOVED it.

257097884,1,2014-08-01,United Kingdom,"This was my first time going to a disneyland and I never expected it to be that bad. Firstly, HKD is way too overcrowded and they don't limit the amount of visitors there is a day, I believe that 200 people should be the maximum since I only went to a couple of rides: space mountain ( fast track ticket ) , Buzz lightyear astro blasters, jungle river cruise, Autopia, It's a small world, stitch encounter and slinky dog spin. For me, the stitch encounter and the slinky dog spin was the worst because the stitch encounter was basically watching Stitch talk and having a chance of talking to him ( on screen, for children ) and I thought it was a ride, the que was horribly long ( 1 hour on a hot day ) The slinky dog ride was very bad either, 45  minute que to go on a dog ride ( 3 4 laps of a a circle ) which made the ride less than 1 hour. However, I do recommend Autopia, space mountain, astro blastersand the jungle river cruise. On the other hand, the food there was disgusting and dry which costed 98 hong kong dollars ( equivilent to   9.80 uk money ) What a rip off       . The staff had bad manners, the one i experienced was the one in the jungle river cruise. Somehow, they show disrespect to mainland China people since my family and I split the group in half because half of us wanted to rest and half of us wanted to go on rides, so they found a ride and they called us to go and when we reached there they didn't let us through since they thought we were que cutting but my family was at the front of the que and they were talking disrespectfully to my uncle as his first language is mandarin but his cantonese is good. But, when my mum came and spoke cantonese they went silent and let us through. Here we can the see the discrimination between hongkongese and chinese mainlanders. Also, people from south west china have better manners than mainlanders so I don't understand why they think we are mainlanders. Im from the UK and find this a rasict. In conclusion, I found HKD terrible, I do not reccomend HKD to people because of the overcrowded visitors. The positive thing about this trip is that you get to watch the 9:00pm fireworks and get to LEARN YOUR LESSON. The park opens at 8:00 or 9:00 and closes at 10:00 but when my family arrived, there were a bunch of people already there. Also, be careful since you are at risk of having your children lost.

165830635,5,2013-06-01,United States,"As a father of four and a senior reviewer I decided to write a review to help big families like ours save some money at the Happiest Place on Earth. We already know about Disneyland and its greatness. If you don't, get out from under your rock, ask a friend, and research their website. So here are the tips to save money: 1. Bring food and drinks. Yes believe it or not the employees are very  accommodating  about this. They understand how expensive it is in the park so they will just remind you at the bag check that the picnic area is to the left of the entrance but they will not ask you to throw it away. The advantage to you is that they won't check your bag again at the entrance turnstyle so you can walk right in with your food. 2. When you line up for a ride, make sure you get a rider switch pass so you can ride again without having to get in another long line. You can only do this if you have a child that is not big enough to ride and one parent must stay back with that child. The pass will allow your kids to ride twice, once with you and once with mom. How does this save you money, well because the new scam that people do is to pay the handicap to ride with them so they can cut in front of the line. True story google it. 3. If you are unable to bring food there are decent prized restaurants inside Disneyland   Rancho del Zocalo Mexican Food behind Thunder Railroad. They serve big dishes to share. In California Adventure   Boardwalk Pizza and Pasta share a whole pizza. 4. Eat the food that you bring for lunch but leave the park for dinner. There are a million food choices within a 5 mile radius of the park ranging from McDonalds to Morton's Steak House. 5. You must buy a two day park hopper. It's impossible to do both parks in one day on a non busy day let alone a busy day. Although this is an expensive ticket, it's much cheaper than buying two one day tickets. As for parking, your out of luck. The only way you can save on that is if your hotel offers a free shuttle to the park. HOT TIP: Get a fast pass early in the morning for the most popular rides such as,  Radiator Springs Racers.",Disneyland_California

164530368,4,2012-07-01,United Kingdom,"Visited Disneyland Paris as a day trip as we weren't actually staying at the theme park, the whole experience is something me and my friends enjoyed and found amazing to see our childhood in reality!! We went at what I presume was a very busy time (July) which meant we had to queue for a very long time and didn't actually manage to get on many rides. However even when you weren't on the rides there were lots of different quirky things to see and do such as seeing all the characters and being in different zone e.g. alice in wonderland. If I went back I would recommend staying in the park for your holiday as you need a long time to see all what's on offer.",Disneyland_Paris

207918299,3,2014-05-01,United Kingdom,"Parks very similar to those found in USA, but staff were so miserable, unfriendly and unsmiling in Paris. Certainly no Disney magic was to be found here. Several of the big rides were not running, which was disappointing. Everything very expensive. Although the park was fairly quiet, we still had to queue for up to 45 minutes as the rides were only running at half capacity. (Half the carriages in the backlot tour tram were empty for example), so it felt like we wasted a lot of time queuing needlessly. The biggest pity was the noticeable lack of Disney magic due to the attitude of the staff.",Disneyland_Paris

192311172,4,2013-12-01,Canada,"Our family of 4 went to Disneyland for the third time but it was our youngest child's  4 yrs old  first visit. Disneyland is so great to visit around the holidays due to all of the extra decorations and lights (especially when lit up at night). The wait times during the day seemed to be manageable but once the late afternoon hits, the locals like to come down to enjoy the festivities too which made Disneyland very busy at night. Overall, this was another great Disney trip with the highlights:Haunted MansionIt's a Small WorldFireworks (in front of the castle)Fantasmic  see my other review Splash MountainIndiana JonesMatterhorn bobsledsStar Tours (new and improved)Buzz LightyearSince our oldest child (9 years old) was tall enough to go on all of the amusements rides, it made this trip extra special. Our kids can't wait to go back and neither can we.Advice: If you have young kids, I would recommend bringing a stroller as kids can get pretty tired from all of the walking plus it's very expensive to rent a stroller for the day ($15 I think). Also if your kids want to meet the Frozen (movie) characters, get in line early as there were long line ups for Anna and Elsa during our visit.",Disneyland_California
362736667,3,2016-01-01,United Kingdom,"I thought the whole Disney experience was expensive, as expected, however for not much more you could have gone to Florida! As it was the winter they were doing lots of maintenance which saw many rides closed. The shops virtually all sell the same items at the same price within the park. There isn't a great variety of food available inside mainly snacks. Staff weren't overly friendly which if I'm honest I thought was a shame. I have visited Florida before and the Disney experience is far more magical and happy than it was in France. I certainly won't be visiting again as it is missing the excitement and magic. The fireworks at night are now mainly projections onto the castle  they were effective. The parade was only running once a day which again was fun to watch but not particularly long.",Disneyland_Paris

The park is smaller than others we have visited and on occasion we did feel  squashed  in. One thing we did notice was the height restrictions were not adhered to as strictly as Florida and people did on occasion queue jump.

341280826,4,2016-01-01,United States,"The Disney Magic is alive and well in Disneyland. The imagineers and cast members excellently craft rides and experiences that will transport you. Now if they can actually transport you around the park (railroad was not running when we were there, nor were quite a few other attractions, including one of my faves from Disneyworld  Haunted mansion ) with people movers, or bike cabs, or something, perhaps they could abolish the overwhelming number of exhausted adults and kids wilting on every single bench, chair, curb, etc. throughout the park. That said, we all slept like babies after our two long days at the park.I was traveling with my husband (we're both 50) and our 14 and 12 year old kids. We realized quickly that our kids had outgrown QUITE a few of the attractions, and were mainly interested in the big thrill rides. In some ways, that was a good thing, since the lines for the big thrill rides are incessant on a crowded January holiday weekend. We succeeded in using the fastpass system for early rides on Hyperspace Mountain (my fav) and Indiana Jones. We opted to wait until the end of the night during the fireworks to stand in an hour long (better than the over 2 hour wait earlier) final ride on Hyperspace mountain. What a blast!Our other favorites here were Thunder Mountain Railroad (used fastpass to ride 2x) and SPlash Mountain (did the same). We also did a first thing in the morning Peter Pan, which was sweet fun, but we wouldn't spend 45  minutes in line for it later in the day. The line was 15 miins first thing in the am. We did a few other quiet rides in between fastpasses. The kids liked Matterhorn, but it was too bumpy and uncomfortable for us old folk. I'm glad we did the park experience since we are living temporarily in SoCal. But for the expense ($600 so cal passes for the family for two days   $115 a night in hotel   expensive disney mediocre food) I think we won't return. Probably need to do a six flags instead to keep up with the kids' need for speed. Great thing to do once though!",Disneyland_California

Snacks stalls do shut down in the evening. There are restaurants that remains open. Evening is the best, as the temperature is cooler and after 6pm or so, we were able to get on all the rides we wanted to as the wait times were anywhere from 0 to 20 minutes, except the night time stuff and kids rides in Fantasyland   lots of kids even at night! The rafts to the treehouse closes in the evening, but do go around 5 6pm to avoid standing in line. Part of Toy Story Land was also blocked off when we got there around 7pm ish.

And it kicks butt, as you enter there are lots of shops all themed after the Pixar movie Cars. the centerpiece is the beautifully designed Radial Springs Racers. This is a fun attraction to ride but also quite amazing just to look at, with vast rock formations and an archway. In the ride you travel past talking cars and have minor adventures before you embark on a race with a neighbor car, and you really don't know who will win. But it's a rush. I advise getting in line for the park before it opens and head to the fast pass line, as they get used up quickly, the patrons who stayed in one of three Disney hotels get in the park one hour early so they are already lined up for the ride. Otherwise you can get on the ride more quickly if you use single rider line,m which worked well for us.

Celebrating our daughters 18th birthday this year we chose the hotel New York and were excited at the 25th anniversary free half board upgrades. There was very little information available on the half board options until we checked in, where you finally find out all the 'cans and cannots'. Got there to find our breakfast had to be taken at cafe Hyperion in the park   if we wanted breakfast in our own hotel it was over   50 a day supplement! Ok, so we head over the the cafe, voucher in hand, queue like cattle for half an hour, to be given this disgusting, rubbery 'omelette burger' and dry, stale croissants. So much for a 'free upgrade'. More like a stab in the back downgrade. And the half board dinner vouchers, well of course everywhere is fully booked (they didn't ask tell me to book restaurants when I spent half hour on the phone to them booking our holiday). So now we're here all we can get is fast food, which is ridiculously overpriced and pretty revolting, again   thanks for the free 'upgrade'. In order to convince one you are getting free special upgrade offers they've downgraded all the services so if you want the standard you've been used to in the park, you've got to pay more whilst you're here. Sneaky, callous and underhand way of making more money and getting people through the door. Absolutely disgusted, Disney.

We made the most of extra magic hours to get the rides open for this done before the main crowds hit for the day. We also made sure we had made dining reservations in advance so skipped the long stand by lines for restaurants. We also researched on line before the trip what counter service options were available (so it wasn't all burgers and fries!) and what times these locations were open at.

We have already visited Disney in Orlando a few times with my older children and had heard that compared to the Florida experience, Euro disney can be a disappointment. Yes of course the Florida collection of parks has more to offer but we absolutely loved our time here. Top tip would be make use of your extra magic hours if staying on the resort as the place does get very busy and head for attractions you have noted long waiting times from previous days. There are plenty of character opportunities and again get there early as they can be very popular, especially the Mickey Mouse encounter, also featuring father Christmas at the far end of the park and the Princess encounter. But do persevere as my little one fell in love with Mickey and we have some excellent photos to treasure. On the subject of photos, if your going to be there for a few days do get the PhotoPass, but probably not worth it if there just for the day.At the entrance of the park the hotel has two restaurants, we had a meal at the Inventions Buffet, yes a little on the pricey side said but well worth it and the food selection was amazing.The parades as you would expect were amazing, don't get to worried about setting up too early, we witnessed people getting a place sometimes over an hour before they start, we didn't and just found a place when they actually began, its easily done and the parade route covers such a wide area.The Frozen stage show was great as was the night fireworks with Olaf on the castle...tough to keep the little one up for though.All the rides were of a high quality although if I had to be a little critical the Buzz Lightyear ride felt like it had seen better days and perhaps could do with a overhaul.Even the guide was excellent and must rides if you too have a little one would be Small, Small World and basically all the ride along family rides.

It'll guarantee you a much more pleasant stay at the park, with staff being more than happy to assit you.

The Disneyland app is a must! P.S. Bummed that the Haunted Mansion was out of service.",Disneyland_California
297635429,5,2015-07-01,United Kingdom,"The park is absolutely massive, we are a family of 7 and found it hard to please all of the kids due to the size of the park, we found the best time to visit was in the morning as ride times were reduced to roughly 15 to 30 mins, after 12 these were constantly 60 mins plus. We planned what rides the kids absolutely wanted to go on and arrived early and went straight to those rides first. We were pleasantly surprised with the cost of items within the shops and we're happy that there was a McDonald's within the Disney Villiage area. The only thing we were disappointed with was that you could not take a buggy into any of the attractions, and when we visited the lift in the castle was not working and as I am disabled I could not go up the castle with our youngest 2. Overall a fantastic holiday and we are rebooking for next year.",Disneyland_Paris

235341722,5,2014-10-01,United States,"Disneyland still continues to amaze, surprise, while also sometimes providing a slight bit of disappointment. The most recent bit of disappointment came with the discovery that the well hidden Blue Dinosaur Eggs in Tomorrowland have all either hatched, been stolen, or were simply removed completely in recent months. These eggs were a very well hidden secret, and were at the park for years and years. Now, like the Dinosaurs that were supposed to have laid them in the first place, they are extinct. The lego figure in Pirates of the Caribbean is probably still there. My wife and I saw it on our first run through the attraction last week, but noticed it had either fallen over, or had been moved on subsequent rides through over the following days. The entertainment offerings are nice, and mostly overlooked, but still present. Of course, the big ones are still there: Fantasmic and Fireworks. Smaller ones, such as wondering musicians, stage shows, and currently imagineers carving pumpkins, are more overlooked. Also overlooked are smaller details like the old time phones with the party lines you can listen in on in the Market House that my son couldn't get enough of last week. If I were to offer one bit of advice prior to booking a trip to the resort, however, it would be to do your homework on the entertainment schedule before you finalize your trip. During different times of year the Disneyland Resort has different things going on. You don't want to visit the park when your favorite attraction is going to be down for refurbishment, for example. Another example would be that currently Disneyland is going through Halloween Time, where the park will close early on Tuesdays and Fridays in order to put on the Mickey's Not So Scary Halloween party, which is a separate ticketed event that will cost visitors $63 dollars per ticket. That's not a bad price to enter the park at 3 or 4 PM and stay until midnight. However, if you've not done your homework, you're going to end up paying full price for a day that ends at 6 PM to 7 PM, depending if you want to stick around on Main Street shopping for the last hour. If you didn't buy a Park Hopper, then you're screwed for the rest of the day. Or, if you purchased a regularly priced ticket, and a Halloween Party ticket on top of that, well, I hope you get tons of candy, because I can't help but feel you've just been screwed out of an additional $63 per person in your party. Of course, others aren't going to think like that, but I sure have every time I've done the party over the last half decade. That being written, I have to admit that while attending these Halloween parties, I have viewed some of the most creative costumes I've ever seen. The candy in 2014 is a big step up from previous years, as well, which is welcome. I hated getting Dumb Dumbs and Tootsie Rolls before. This year, I didn't get any of that junk.",Disneyland_California

We knew it was going to cost a lot to get in, but we weren't quite prepared for the amount charged,   250 for 3 adults and one junior, for one day. The whole place is a magical experience, or should have been until one of the assistants selling ice creams couldn't wouldnt understand what a  cash refund  for items she didn't have, meant. She thought that as she had given me my change from a 20 euro note, the amount of change already given had to be deducted from the full refund amount. It was only when another member of staff arrived that I got my money back. By the time it was eventually sorted out, there was a long line of very unhappy customers, this made the whole episode very embarrassing and upsetting. You are not allowed to take your own food into the actual park, be prepared to pay well over the odds for food, it costs us over   100 for the 4 of us to eat a meal. A  cornetto  icecream cost over   3 each.

358792848,4,2016-03-01,United States,"We've always loved Disneyland and all the associated parks on the West and East Coasts. But it makes us a little sad now. The parks have been pushing things for people to buy forever, but it seems the focus now. We 1st noticed this several years ago when we took the kids on the Disney Cruise. We thought maybe it just had to do with the closer quarters on board the ship, we don't thing so now. There's a giant green monster hovering over all the parks growling,  BUY, BUY, BUY! . Pretty sure that wasn't Walt's dream. I choose not to ride Splash Mountain with my family, so I sat on a shaded bench and people watched. A dad, mom and daughter about 6 years old walked by hand in hand. I over heard the mom ask her little girl,  You don't like it here? . The little girl looked down and then slowly looked at her mom and shook her head no. I couldn't blame her. It was crowded and what did she really see? Much larger, taller people all pushing around each other. My kids are 19 and 22 now and when I told them what I heard and saw they looked around and said it seemed a much friendlier place when they were little. My son was disappointed to see that not all the Disney staff were not wearing the pin lanyards. He's a 6'2  football player, but he still likes to rock his pins that he collected when he was young. We have a frame from Disneyland for the 50th Anniversary with a picture of us all there. I looked around and asked about a 60th frame for a 5x7 photo we had taken on this trip.

When we spoke to staff they said they only release about 75 slots, well when there are thousands of people there is next to no chance of getting one! Very disappointing. Why not dot the characters around and if people want to see them they will queue like at the other park. Food was way overpriced, four hot dogs cost 60euros.

207445474,5,2013-07-01,India,"Walt Disney got the idea when he took out his kids to an amusement park. He planned the attraction to come up in Burbank, CA. That was way back in the WWII times. The Disneyland as we know of it today, came up in 1955 in a 160 acre plot in Anaheim, CA. Almost immediately any kid worth his salt in the USA dragged his parents to it. So did people from outside the country. In fact any one familiar with the antics of Donald Duck, the writer included, Mickey Mouse, Pluto and Goofy wanted to be there. To relive the fantasy that shaped all the fun and innocence of childhood.Today the resort attraction has vastly expanded both in area and content. And that effort continues even as I write this. Walt stands with his rodent hero, in metal welcoming visitors to the Sleeping Beauty Castel. My last visit again with family, was facilitated by my grown up kids. They bought the wife and me a single day visit pass. Again, we just couldn   t get enough. Yes, I know we need to plan well ahead of the visit of the excitement, fun areas to hit on priority. There was the usual excitement and reliving of fantasies for us 60 year olds. In addition to old favorites of playing with pirates and talking cars, there was Alice in Wonderland, Big Thunder, Davy Crocket   s exciting boat ride, train rides, Finding Nemo voyage   and several things that thrilled and exhausted us no end. Of course, we forgot our age, and the child in us had a ball.See pics. some are from our first visit.",Disneyland_California

Average queue time for kids rides was about 30mins.We opted for the 3 in 1 meal pass which worked out best for us.Our lunch meal was at royal banquet hall which was surprisingly very good, considering it was theme park food.

244858468,4,2014-12-01,United States,"Visited for 5 days, staying at the Disneyland Hotel and generally we had a great time. The weather was cold but mainly dry and apart from the Saturday we were there the park was relatively quiet. Not much has changed in the park over recent years so don't expect to go back and see a range of new attractions and rides. This was our first visit over Christmas and we were impressed with the Christmas theming and in particular the snow which is blown at intervals over Main Street. The Christmas tree 'lighting' session was good, as was the light show and the parade (while it lasted).There are a few things which could be better. The fact that so many people smoke in a park designed for children remains pretty gob smacking, it is literally everywhere including queues. Getting in and out of the park is a pretty tedious experience when you have a stroller, requiring a member of staff to scan your tickets and then open a doorway between the turnstiles for you. Extra Magic hours are pretty much a waste of time. The best element of this is that you can get into the park ahead of the large queues forming at the gate but once inside there is so little open it really is of no value. The queues for the characters were incredibly long. We were lucky that in staying at the Disneyland hotel our daughter got to meet some princesses and other characters in the lobby and at breakfast etc, the princess pavilion we did not see as an option as we could not face a 2 to 3 hour plus wait in the cold. Lastly, some of the behaviour of adults in the park can be a little annoying. We queues patiently with our toddler to watch the light show, only for a family to stand literally in front of us with their children on their shoulders which meant we could see bugger all. At the parades it could literally be bedlam with people pushing and shoving. Overall the issues above were small compared to the enjoyment we had in the parks, they just edge the experience down from being perfect, however.",Disneyland_Paris

Thankfully we'd taken some diluted juice squeezy things so the kids could have some blackcurrant juice.Queues weren't too bad in this park  Walt Disney studios was horrific.Definitely go on pirates of the carribean, pinocchio, dumbo and small world rides.The parade was amazing but you need to be there an hour early to get a decent spot  and beware you will get a lot of people turn up at the last minute and try and push you out of the way (I was horrified at the amount of adults prepared to push children)Disney dreams also a must see but might be a bit late and noisy for very little ones and it is insane trying to get out when it finishes.",Disneyland_Paris
558382621,5,2017-12-01,China,"It was an amazing day at Paris Disneyland. We took the train to the park which was very convenient and easy. We started in the Studio in the morning, and we recommend to start on this side because this area tends to have more people lining up for thrilling rides. The best ride for me was Hyperspace mountain on the Disney Park side, and rode it twice, and it was the most thrilling ride in the park with 360 degree turns.The park was not very full as we only waited for about 30 to 45 minutes for each ride, and we got to go on most rides.Definitely would recommend to stay for the fireworks, although leaving the park will be difficult because everyone is trying to leave at the same time, especially when it is raining, in our case.",Disneyland_Paris

374625411,4,2016-05-01,India,"This is great place to take your little one. I was amazed to see my daughter's face when she was looking at fantacyland castle , characters dancing in parade ....I hope to come back there. You should plan your trip properly , reach there by 9:30 AM at least to see different characters at the main street (main entrance) .... It is advisable to complete fantacyland first as those become crowded later & those closes first too.... It's Small world  is mast if you are taking your children. You can target to go there by 2:30 so that you finish that up by 3:30 pm. After that you take some place in the same street to see the parade which starts from Main street (entrance) at 4:30 PM. Don't forget to take mat to sit on the street. You can enjoy different rides there after that.Later half you can target adventure park & other area & walk towards main street for Mickey's soundasation Parade starts at 8:30  8:45 PM. Again its best you reserve some place on the street earlier to best enjoy the show. Later you can stay there for firework, Unfortunately on 14th , due to weather, it was cancelled which something you need to be ready too :(.Please carry the following   cap, sun glass, sunscreen, Mat, lots of water. Don't get trolley bag because trolley bags are not allowed.jackets sweaters (as sometime its very windy, your children might feel cold).Overall, its really great place to visit.",Disneyland_California

Seeing we were going to be in Paris, we figured we might as well hit up the local Disneyland, even if it was cold and rainy. We were able to see the park when it wasn't so crowded so that was a relief....all Disneys become nightmares in busy season.There were local touches that were appreciated since you are in France vs. the US. It is nice to see the regional influences and the differences between the parks. This park isn't one of our favorite Disney's but still worth a visit.",Disneyland_Paris
210290245,2,2014-06-01,United States,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge Disney fan who's dragged my family to Disneyland once (sometimes twice) a year for the last 25 years. Our last few visits have been okay, nothing stellar, but after our visit this year, I think I'm finally ready to hang up my Mickey ears. We visited the first week of June and were surprised to see that Space Mountain was down for refurbishment. Why wouldn't that take place during the off season? In addition, there were prolonged breakdowns of Indiana Jones, Big Thunder Mountain, and Splash Mountain during the ONE DAY we visited. So we headed over to California Adventure, only to find that California Screamin' and the new Radiator Springs Racers were also down for part of the day, and Grizzly River Run was closed for refurbishment. If I am now paying $150 for a one day park hopper ticket, I have some expectations that the rides will at least be working. With all the big rides down, everyone was funneled into the smaller rides, so lines were extremely long.We expected Disneyland to be crowded, but it was absolutely bursting at the seams, and every pathway was congested by 11:00 a.m. We had planned to stay and watch Fantasmic, but the crowds just became too much, and we left at 7:00 p.m. The overall cleanliness of the park left something to be desired as well, with dirty bathrooms the norm, and trash noticed along Main Street. The quality of the merchandise has gone downhill, too, as we found nothing worth purchasing in any of the stores. My daughter was particularly disappointed that there was absolutely no Olaf merchandise (from Frozen), which you think would have been everywhere. Overall, it was a disappointing trip, and the entire family concluded that we did not need to visit there again anytime soon.",Disneyland_California
530866762,5,2017-09-01,United Kingdom,"Visited on a week day in September and we had an amazing day. The park was really quiet and we did not wait in any lines all day. We arrived on the train at about 10am for a 10:30am opening and we breezed straight through the bag checks and joined the lines to get in. They opened Main Street early for some shopping which was perfect as we had the chance to scope out some purchases for later in the day. Most of the park opened at 10:30 and we headed straight to Adventureland to ride Jungle Cruise. They have the option for several different languages which is great for visitors that don't speak English. We then waited a few minutes for Grizzly Gulch to open and headed for a few rides on that and then Mystic Manor. They had an interactive marvel attraction thing happening which was good. Without giving a full run down of the day we pretty much managed everything we wanted to go on and saw all the parades, fireworks and special Halloween happenings. The magic book show was brill. I think it's a bit disappointing that they cancel Paint the Night for Halloween as the Halloween parade was average in comparison. Tomorrowland is a little sad at the minute with all of the renovations but we loved the Iron Man experience, a nice evolution of star tours. Overall a great day, this Disney park is one of my favourites and the merchandise was way better than Shanghai Disneyland.",Disneyland_HongKong

449807396,5,2016-12-01,United Kingdom,"I've been to Disneyland Paris a few times now, it is a great little park. It is however not a cheap little park and is very busy and lacking the American Fast Food and line management skills.Get organised if you are here for a short time. You will queue for around 90 120 mins for a character signature. You will queue the same for food. The whole idea of get them in, get them served, get them to pay, get them out just doesn't exist, anywhere. There was no good time of the day to eat, all restaurants cafes had people queuing out of the doors and most restaurants were fully booked for the next month. We ended up taking food to eat in queues not only saved us time but also a fortune.You have an option to buy Meal Deals. I now understand why. If you are on a budget then I do recommend these. There is no cheap food. We met a mother with a very hungry child who spent 14 Euros on a small plate of chips and a hot chocolate to get her through. Also if there is a special place you want to eat, reserve it before you leave.The next thing is to plan your visit, especially if you are here for a short time. We were here between Christmas and New Year and it took us 4 days to do most of the 2 parks. If you want to meet characters and do rides, then plan your days around the evenings. By sunset a lot of the queues are quieter and you can do more quickly. Also fast track some of the major rides to save you time. Add in time to get to a good view point for the parades. One of the parades happens twice a day, but check the programme to see what else is on. They are great. Also the firework and light display as the park closes is magical.This is a magical park for your children and the child in you. It's not cheap and it isn't as organised as its American Cousins, but it's closer to home, it has a direct train link into it and is the most wonderful experience.",Disneyland_Paris

265968858,4,2015-04-01,New Zealand,"I am not sure what I actually expected with Disneyland. I used to love watching the 'Magic Castle' on anyof the Disney movies and programmes as a child (some 40 odd years ago now) and thought it would be the most magical place to visit. I guess as you grow up you can lose some of that magical feeling (well I had ). However it was still amazing to see it in person and the fantastic animation on the rides that Disney is so famous for. Unfortunately we were there at Spring Break which according to one employee wasn't really that busy (compared to Thanksgiving   Dec Jan period), but the queues for rides were pretty horrendous and we had not mastered the Fastpass system. Our 1 year old loved it and spent a full day there by himself and the rest of us met him for the night shows early evening. Was definitely very clean and staff (or cast members as they are referred to) were very pleasant and helpful. Plenty to do and see and buy!!! The parking was well sign posted. We had purchased 3 day passes which included entry into Calfornia Adventure Park and parking for the three days. The tickets are valid for 13 days from when first used so during the 8 days in LA could choose when we went back. We didn't stay in Anaheim but if your sole purpose is to visit Disneyland, would recommend staying close by. It was a great place just not for me or my husband or youngest son. We did not enjoy the crowds or waiting for rides but this is par for the course at Disneyland so I wouldn't give it a bad review based on my dislike of those things. Certainly can't go to LA without visiting the 'Happiest Kingdom of All'",Disneyland_California

It was wonderful and I would highly recommend the fast pass options and stroller switch. Everyone was very nice and my kids had a wonderful time. My biggest complaint though is the character experiences. This had to be the most disappointing part of the whole thing. We have two girls ages 4 and 6 that love all the characters. However when we tried to get pictures with them it never worked.. About 4 different times we stood in line only for them to say after we stood there for about 10 minutes that it was now over and we had to try again. Then one time we waited and were up to Minnie and they asked for our Disney Visa? My husband said we did not have one and they said well this is only for Disney Visa holders.. Huh. My husband said my Visa card that we paid 1500 to come here isnt good enough. So we walked away with crying girls not understanding why they could not see Minnie.Very frustrating. I would recommend the Bibbity Bobbity Boutique though. Worth it and my girls loved it!,Disneyland_California
599106294,4,2018-07-01,United States,"We visited the park for just one day, we were very impressed by the entrance which has i assume to be the most expensive hotel in france right by the turnstyles.getting to the entrance is another story, we walked for what seemed like 10 miles just to get to the entrance, the park does not have a transport system like florida so you have to walk for ages.Ticket prices are also very reasonable, we paid   51 each by using a ticket site not the official disney site, this is cheap when you consider how much disneyworld charge, between $100 and $120 dollars. Parking is expensive at    25 which has always been my biggest gripe.First impressions of the park were it is just a slightly smaller version of disneyworld in florida. We heard horror stories about ths customer service and general attitude of the staff in the park but were pleasantly surprised with their helpfulness. The other visitors to the park were the problem, pushing and shoving and generally being ignorant towards the staff and other visitors.The costs of everything in the park were what we expect from disney, all overpriced, the food was expensive as were the gifts, if you are a regular visitor to disney parks it wont be a surprise.We spoke to a couple who were staying at a disney hotel and they told us they had paid   2700 for a 4 day stay for a family of 4, for another   1000 they could have stayed in kissimmee with a car for 16 days..If you want rides in the park you will be disappointed, they are very scarce and the queues are huge.On the plus side the pirates of the carribean ride is a lot better than the one in disneyworld.Meeting the characters is easy and meeting mickey is a delight.Would we go again?

If there are horde of people waiting for the tram to Mickey and Friends parking structure, you can always choose to walk to the parking via Downtown Disney.

It   s something you should definitely do in your life, but you have to do it right:1) go early on days projected to be not crowded.2) get max pass and use the fast passes wisely for the popular rides. (They charge you extra for max pass, but it   s worth it. This is an example of them being greedy when you   re already shelling out tons to get in and 20 bucks to simply park.)3) bring some snacks so you don   t have to buy expensive food for every meal.Follow that advice and you will have a great time.

A lot of the rides that had animatronics had some that were not working (It's a Small World, Pirates of the Caribbean).

Do it on your phone it's much easier than having to find a Max pass booth. Plan a head and make a couple of food reservations you can always cancel but good luck trying to get into one if there very good restaurants without a reservation. Make reservations a head for Downtown Disney also.,Disneyland_California
184973181,4,2013-06-01,United Kingdom,"After a ten year Disney break I have had the fortune to visit Disneyland Paris twice this year as an adult. The first time was in early December at the Hotel Cheyenne and the second was in August staying in the Kyriad.Things are certainly different from an adult perspective, the cost of food, the maintenance issues and lack of shows etc due to funding being piled into Dreams and 20th birthday celebrations.Admittedly they do need to try and bring the park up to previous standards, it is looking a little run down and tired especially in the summer.However! I had an absolutely wonderful time if you allow yourself to be swept up into the fun. I personally preferred the Christmas season and am returning again this December! There is something magical about Disney that even though it isn't perfect, you can't help but feel like you're somewhere special.",Disneyland_Paris

They also should allow more fast passes and be need to become diligent in regards to the amount of ppl who   hold    space in line  1 person will hold the space and after 30 min or so, they text their 2 6 (on average ) rude family members (or friends) to join them and cut in line. This was a huge problem esp in Oct during the Halloween crowds. A ton of ppl felt as we did and were infuriated at the lack of respect a lot of the park goers had as they just acted like cutting in line  holding spaces  same thing  inviting others you know to line jump  was perfectly within their rights. There   s no words I can print here for how I (as well as a lot of others we spoke to in lines these last 7 days at the Disney parks) felt about these classless jerks. And the worst part is they are, for the most part, 30 50 something   s doing this. An age group who all should know better.

Located about 30 kms from Paris you can get there easily taking the RER (costs about 7 Euros).You only need to walk a block and a half to see the main entrance. While the park is smaller than his big brother in California well worth spending a whole day visiting and enjoy all possible attractions.

Everyone was really pleasant & helpful without the sugary sweetness that can sometimes be the American way. The best trick is to approach people with a smile & you will always get the best from them. Pre booking the restaurants with the concierge was brilliant & we never experienced any waiting times. Walt's, the Steakhouse & the Silver Spur were all excellent.The rides were great & we managed to avoid too many lengthy queues. The magic hours worked well & the occassional fast pass was a life saver! We tended to start out early in the morning, stay at the park until early afternoon, recharge our batteries by the pool, and then continue on with the rides after dinner. The queues were generally much shorter from 9pm onwards. Definitely the magical experience we were hoping for!",Disneyland_Paris

420632160,5,2016-09-01,United States,"Our multi generational group enjoyed our visit to Anaheim and the two Disney parks, especially as we usually visit Walt Disney World. Compared to the Florida parks, these are very compact. (Just look at that cute, little castle!) Disneyland is the older of the two parks and differs from DCA and WDW  smaller and more crowded walkways, outdoor queues, and very walkable. As with any Disney visit these days, a little planning can really enhance your experience, although the lead time for dining reservations, etc. is much shorter. Fast Passes are the old paper kind, but that system still works wonderfully if you know what you are doing. (It was amazing to us how many people asked us what those little pieces of paper were that let us get to the head of the line! They are free! Seems most of the uninformed guests thought they were at an additional cost. At DL you can actually have two Fast Passes at once if one is for Buzz Lightyear. Hardly anyone we spoke to knew that!) And by staying on site we got early admission to both parks. It helped more at DCA, but any jump you can get on the crowds is a plus. Just don't plan on too much advantage if the Early Magic Hour is at 9 instead of earlier.",Disneyland_California

USA street is the best with live music and bands playing, original coca cola store restaurant ( try their potato shrimps and chicken wings) and many shops for Disney products.

Only one breakdown this year   thunder mountain railway. A few of the rides had been upgraded which was a nice surprise. A new xmas evening light show at Walt Disney studios was good. We did have the same issue as last year   the kids getting on rides then later in the day being refused as they were too small, im now convinced that the kids get slightly smaller as the day goes on so we ride at the start of the day. Had a few buffets and as usual the only one worth doing is cafe agrabah. We left out a couple of rides that we could not fast pass as the queue was too long but it was xmas as the busy period.

There aren't as many as the states which sucks a little because I enjoy taking photos with characters the most but I guess not many Americans want to work at HKDL? Characters include Mickey, Minnie, goofy, Pluto, pooh, tigger, Donald Duck, belle, Snow White, aurora, Cinderella, tinker bell, Alice, and sometimes Rapunzel. If you're Chinese and you speak English, make sure you talk to the face characters! I find that they enjoy being able to converse with guests, since most tourists are from Mainland China and don't speak English!

It's a great day out tfor the family. I spent 9 hours there with my family (daughter 10 and 8) and we had a ball. There are plenty of cool drinks available when its hot, plenty of seats for a quick break and enough diversity in the attractions to keep it interesting. In July, it was hot and steamy, but with some sunscreen, appropriate dress and plenty of cool water you can still enjoy the slightly franctic nature of it all.

We have been to Disney World a couple of times and thought it would be nice to visit Disneyland this year. We were expecting pretty much the same experience, but this was not the case. Disneyland is much smaller, they do not offer many accommodation options nor do they have as many attractions and activities as Disney World. I agree with several other reviews which mention that the entrance is pretty pricey, especially considering the size of the park. We traveled in mid January and since we normally always buy park hopper tickets we did the same here, but then noticed that it was not necessary. The first reason being that during this time of the year there were not many visitors in the park, which made it easy to go from one ride to the next without a long wait time, and the second reason because Disneyland only has two parks. If we would've known this beforehand we would have only purchased 2 day tickets without the park hopping option. Food here is also pricey, and they do not have as many dining options as Disney World. In conclusion, I don't think we will be returning, first because we like Disney World better and second because we enjoy visiting Orlando.",Disneyland_California

Get there early nonetheless... It's ridiculously easy to access by public transport from Central Paris and as we got there pretty much as soon as the gates opened (and even then, not really, a good 30mins after), we walked straight through. We did already have tickets, so not sure how much that eased our progress. It is definitely recommended to check out timings of parades and princesses etc. in advance. By the time we'd been on a few rides (little rides, we were with a 3 yr old and 5 yr old) we decided (were forced) to go and meet Rapunzel. There was a 90min wait, inside and round a corridor (nicely done, but very much inside with no air con on a 30  C day) and apparently this was a short wait... Rapunzel was spectacular though, it must be said. But we were there no more than a few minutes, nonetheless (I think you can spend longer, but the little 'uns had run out of questions). There is heaps to see and do. I now understand how people can spend a few days there but I would strongly recommend taking your own food. As ever, pricey and pretty rank (I'm talking about the one place we ate at...) And, as you'd imagine, there are a loooooot of temptations for the kiddiewinks to demand you pull the wallet out for...But there are parades and meetings and dances and...

The room still had rubbish in it when we arrived & they didn't even provide tea or coffee in the rooms. You are allocated a time for breakfast & then still have to queue for 25min to be seated. On arrival we were railroaded into having breakfast at the Plaza Gardens one morning but didn't know where that was we then found out it's a good 20 minute walk into the park & I was using a walking stick for a knee injury. The park itself is just a huge shopping centre. The food is overpriced and poor   even the coffee at 5 euros was undrinkable  many people we met complained that it was cold and that there was no choice. A lot of the park was a building site and the queues over an hour   I dread to think what it is like in peak season when the weather is better. My 7year old & I queued for over an hour to get to meet a princess and they turned around and said she was leaving. A number of very angry parents complained and after another 15 minutes she came back but apparently this is common practice. There is no care for how this affects children all they want is for you to spend money on expensive souvinirs and overpriced food. Of course once you have paid there is nowhere to go with it and you don't have any alternative choices as it is such a closed shop. Not worth the money at all.

279919234,4,2015-06-01,United Kingdom,"Over 1 day of our holiday was spent queueing for rides at various theme parks. Disneyland was the worst . My advice is to arrive by 8am and get on any rides you can and get fast passes for others. By 10am fast passes were for 5pm so dont stay in bed if you want to get on the rides. At lunchtime you might as well kick back and go on the kiddy rides or watch shows or go for lunch. At this time the park is also boiling and so busy you can barely move.Even better , get a stamp out and go back to your hotel for a siesta then return later for rides while evryones watching parades or heading home.. It needs to be planned like a military campaign or you will be disappointed. Now after saying all that Disneyland is beautiful, brilliant fun and full of smiles and happiness. We loved the popular rides like Space Mountain,Indiana Jones, Splash Mountain . Food drink prices were high but not as high as Paris ... Water is about   1.80. Coke   2..Frozen lemonade   3...pizza slice about   4. You can take water and snacks into the park. We recommend the pizza place by space mountain.W bought a Socal citypass that gave us 3 days Disney Cali Adventure , 1 day universal, 1 day Seaworld....terrific value....A brilliant experience but totally exhausting.One final tip : when you are too hot and sticky and its 90 degrees go watch the Lincoln show in the coldest air conditioned theatre in the park....",Disneyland_California

(coincidentally, the shanghai stampede accident happened around the same time). we had to stop by the side as people were pushing and shoving.went back the day after in jan 3. we queued at the gate as early as 9:15am (park gates open at 9:30 ish but park rides open at 10am) to make sure we can get a pass for the meet and greet with elsa (characters of frozen). when the gates opened, people were running towards main street to get the pass. i ran with my 8 year old and reached the main street cordon. at 10 am, the cordon was opened and we ran again toward the left side of the fantasyland castle where the passes were being handed out. i saw a mother bringing a folded stroller on one hand and her young toddler's hand on the other. the toddler stumbled and got dragged a few steps. all for just a pass for the meet and greet.we were able to get a pass and was scheduled for a 12 noon meet and greet time. we went to the spot at 11:45 and had been jumped on our queue twice! i hollered but they just ignored me. frustrating. the jan 3 visit was better. not too much people, we were able to get through most of the rides by 2pm. it's a small park after all.we booked a character dining event at the disneyland hotel. i would not recommend it. although food was good but there were only four characters present; mickey, minnie, and two bears whom i don't recall seeing in any of my kids' movies. the price for the buffet dinner was the same price i paid for the two day pass at the resort! i could've done away with the dinner and queued up in the meet and greet sites at the park (only the characters of frozen needed a pass).we were checked in at the novotel city gate and we took the mtr to disney. single journey ticket is hdk14 per adult one way. train change at sunny bay station and took the disney train for the resort.going back to the queueing in the toilets, my wife told me that the cubicles and overall floor area of the toilet facilities were way smaller than disney anaheim. i noticed too that there were a lot of males doing diaper changes for their kids since the queue for the men's toilets were shorter, if any.food quality was average for the burgers and chicken dishes. we frequented the tomorowland restaurant. we tried the chinese restaurant along main street and found their food likewise average but a bit pricey. souvenir prices were cheaper than their US counterparts. roving disney staff can speak english and were very accommodating. the others (especially some ride attendants) can be rude and can't speak and understand english.i asked my 8 year old about her preference if she ever had a chance to come back to disney, she preferred the disney at anaheim. my 6 year old can barely remember his anaheim experience so he cannot compare it with hk. my 2 year old had the time of her life during the times she was awake. overall, the kids enjoyed their time at disney hk. the feel good, happy place experience is prevalent, albeit in tighter quarters, or should i say, in smaller packages.i would recommend this park for it's proximity to other asian cities and also if it's a first time. would i be coming back? i may but not anytime soon. would i be coming back to hongkong just for disney like we did this time? nope.",Disneyland_HongKong

131732678,1,2011-11-01,United Kingdom,"Visited several months ago but decided to write this review as some friends have just returned from this money grabbing hell hole and have related the same experiences that we met. Basically the French should never have been allowed to get their hands on a Disney franchise because a) they don't like foreigners and as tourists tend to be foreigners they make up the majority of visitors here and thus obviously annoys the staff! b) this Disney park is aimed at the French first, then other Europeans (Germans, Dutch...) c) if you are British you get treated with utter disdain. Try explaining to your six year old child why Goofy pushed him out of the way so the French child could take priority for the photograph   try being a mum and wanting to smack Goofy in front of everyone!!!Basically the operators of this park have not got a handle on how to create a Disney experience complete with smiles, laughter and 'feel good' atmosphere. You resent paying 200 euros for your family to get in to be snarled at, shrugged at and pushed and jostled roughly in the queue you have stood in for over an hour by other people of local nationality. Men are the worst, this is a habit I also discovered exists in a couple of theme parks in Spain. I don't mind queing for whatever time it takes to get on a ride but I get real angry when my children have been patient, stood in line, only to have four loud local teenage girls come from under the barrier and stand in front of them. The attendants say nothing and the pusher ins just give you the 'go back where you came from' glare...Food   overpriced junk. Toilets   filthy, take your own toilet paper if you   like most people   tend to use it...Health and Safety   it is the French habit to smoke everywhere so be prepared to endure the stink   mind your young children's eyes and cigarettes are held down at their eye level...as mentioned in several reviews here...dangerous!!!!Queuing   stand your ground over your place in the queue   you WILL get pushed in front of!Language   speak French...? so do we   but the staff like to pretend you cannot.For these reasons alone I would like to see Paris Disney closed down   or old Walt come back and haunt the hell out of the place! awful awful, awful...and I am sure the attitude of staff would earn them the 'R' label here in the UK.",Disneyland_Paris
112827026,5,2011-05-01,India,"Disneyland is a must visit for families vising Hong Kong. Kids will love it. The rides, themes are fantastic. A must ride is the train and boat ride.

496238279,5,2017-06-01,United Kingdom,If you have ever thought of going here then do not delay. Disney have thought of everything to make this a magical trip to remember. We visited on the last weekend of the English school holidays in June and the wait times for rides were between 20mins and 1 hour. There are also water fountains around the park so you can fill up water bottles. If you are staying in the Disney hotels you can get into the main park a 8am and the fireworks show is at 22.30pm. Note that the queues to get into the park can be as long as the rides so get there early. There is so much to do you will struggle to fit it into a few days. All round great time.,Disneyland_Paris
355383773,5,2016-02-01,United Kingdom,"I'm a Disney fanatic and have been to both Disney locations in California and Florida more times than I can count. I've had season passes in both locations for years. When I moved to London I couldn't wait to take a trip to Disneyland Paris, but just never made it. After I realised that it had been almost 3 years since I've visited a Disney Park (the longest time without the mouse in my entire life!), I planned a short girls mid week break with my 15 year old over her February half term. Many naysayers said I'd be disappointed because it was nothing like either of the parks in the US. Well, duh! It was Disneyland Paris, not DisneyWorld or the original Disneyland. If I wanted the experience of either of those, I would have traveled to either of those parks. Yes Disneyland Paris is different, offers different rides and a different vibe. But not bad, just different. Me and my daughter had a great time. We went during the off peak and got a special deal of only   39 each for both parks. We took full advantage of the off peak and went from ride to ride to ride. It wasn't until later that we realised because we were so busy riding, we barely saw any Characters! Downtown Disney is small, but still has the shopping and restaurants. Don't fall under the trap of comparing this park to the parks in the US. Every Disney park is wonderfully different whilst still having that Disney magic!",Disneyland_Paris
202557940,5,2014-03-01,United States,This was our first time here so as a family of four with two teens it was so amazing people were friendly and lines for rides were not too bad we only needed to use the fast pass for splash mountain. We didnt get to ride on space mountain or go to innoventions they were closed because of the earthquakes that had been taking place but other then that we enjoyed ourselves. The places to eat were obviously expensive and we kind of walked in and out of toontown because it was more for younger children. it was truly an amazing experience that my kids and I will always remember.,Disneyland_California
147782289,4,2012-12-01,Singapore,"We bought our admission tickets at our hotel concierge before we went to Disneyland. Thus we avoided the queue for admission tickets at the park entrance.We went early, right on time for the park opening at 10am and head in a beeline straight for the Grizzly Gulch ride. It was a mild roller coaster ride that had part of the ride in reverse direction! As we went there on a weekday and early, we managed to take the ride twice with no wait.After that we immediately went for the other popular rides like Space Mountain and Astro Blaster. Again, we do do the rides twice with little wait.But after 11am, the crowds started appearing and the waits were ranging from 20mins 30mins. Still quite reasonable.Disneyland HK has fastpass tickets for a couple of rides, and we used it for the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh ride, which cut our wait from 40 mins to 15mins.As usual, food & beverage in the park was expensive, though they do have water coolers for you to refill water bottles.The one attraction that surprised us and the kids really enjoyed was the Stitch Encounter. We attended the one in Mandarin, and had a hilarious time in the interaction with Stitch.We left the park around 6pm... spending a total of 8 hours at the park. And the kids enjoyed it!",Disneyland_HongKong
373898654,4,2016-04-01,United States,"This was a very good and a not so good experience. The Pros the park is gorgeous, the rides are similar but differ in fun ways from the parks in us. The roller coasters are SOOO much better, the crowds were smaller, and the park is cheaper to get in then the ones in the US. The Cons are the park is smaller and there are less rides and shows then other Disney parks and the service is not what you except from Disney. The staff members are not rude they are just not as engaging and caring as the ones in the states which makes the experience a little less magical. I am really glad I went to see the differences cause I am a Disney fanatic. But if you are expecting the level of service that you get at Disneyworld you will be disappointed.",Disneyland_Paris

122260858,5,2011-12-01,United States,"We've been to the USA Disney parks 5 times in the last 6 years. The Hong Kong version was definitely smaller, but my kids loved it anyways and spent the entire day from opening to closing there. Space Mountain is the only roller coaster, but it looks like they're in the process of building a Grizzly River Run like the one at California Adventure. It's probably at least 1 2 years away from completion, though. My kids' two favorite American rides, Autopia and Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger Spin were here. They have the iconic Fantasyland rides like It's a Small World, Dumbo, Spinning Teacups and Winnie the Pooh. However, Fantasyland was practically deserted for the 1st hour we were there. It's one of the most popular sections in America, but obviously not in Hong Kong. The big crowd was at Toy Story Land which had only been open for 1 month. We really enjoyed this section (3 rides) since it doesn't exist in the US parks. Even though we only speak English, we were still able to enjoy the shows. All the movie songs are in English. For the Lion King Show, the narrator spoke English while two actors dressed as monkeys provided Chinese translations that fit in the flow of the show. For the Golden Mickeys, the English translation was shown on a screen to the side of the stage. The Jungle Cruise offered an English language cruise. Stitch Encounter shows advertised what language was for what showtimes. However, we didn't do the Animation Academy which I think was only in Chinese. We bought the Star Pass (US$26) which gave us Priority Access to certain shows and rides. For the rides, it acted as a Fast Pass. For the shows, people with a Star Pass were seated before the rest of the crowd. It came in handy for both the Golden Mickeys and the Lion King when we were able to walk up at the last minute, bypass the crowd that had been waiting there for at least 40 minutes, and get front row seats. Just for fun, we took the MTR home from Disneyland to our hotel near the Tsim Sha Tsui station in Kowloon. It took about an hour (versus 25 minute taxi ride) but was very cheap. However, the kids were very tired and I was worried I wouldn't be able to make the 2 transfers with 3 sleepy little ones.",Disneyland_HongKong

However, it is advisable to purchase book your tickets online as the queue is long and you might end up wasting your time just for the tickets alone, thus, you would be missing lots fun and lots of beautiful attractions rides as the the whole day seems never enough.

209911063,2,2014-06-01,United States,"I was so excited to go to the happiest place on Earth with my four kids just a week ago. We did prepare for our trip by using ridemax which helped a lot. We were able to ride almost everything. I would never ever recommend someone go to Disneyland without a plan set out. We saw only 2 characters during our 14 hour visit. They clearly do not have any kind of crowd control going on because it was busier there than Disney World at Christmas! The employees are not as friendly as the cast members at Disney World. In fact a few times they were just downright rude. As we got our hands stamped to leave an employees said to my son,  Hey KID, its THIS WAY!  and thats just not what you get at Disney World. The cast members there (disney world) are taught to treat customers with respect even if they are small. It was not magical and it was way over crowded. You'd think that for as much as they charge to get in, they could manage the crowds a little better. If you hate crowds you will definitely want to skip Disneyland. We were at the front of the line at rope drop and we went straight to Peter Pan's flight and the line was already wrapped around the building. It was total Chaos there. During the parades you are shoulder to shoulder. Once you've been to Disney World, Disneyland is just one big let down. We got to the fireworks an hour early and had to sit almost all the way to the buildings on main street and then we walked straight to fantasmic and there was no seating left. The employee we encountered there was also rude. If you want the experience of Disney but can't make it to Disney World then by all means go just make sure you go EARLY and have a plan (I suggest ridemax). If you want a truly magical experience, skip it and fly to Orlando instead. I am glad we got to mark it off our bucket list but we will not go back.",Disneyland_California

One thing we would say is that Fast Track tickets are well worth buying as some rides can have a wait of more than an hour. The Metro to Disneyland from central Paris is excellent, well recommended. The station is right on the doorstep of Disneyland. One piece of advice is, buy return tickets before you leave the station, as at the end of the day when everyone is leaving Disneyland, the queues to buy tickets are huge.",Disneyland_Paris

385899984,2,2016-06-01,United Kingdom,"Arriving with 26 14 15 year old pupils, we were amazed that they would shut two of the feature rollercoaster rides at the same time in the height of summer. Then we found the third rollercoaster was also shut, opening only half of the day in the end. Other headline rides like Peter Pan and the train and the steamboat were all shut and Fronteirland was a building site. We teachers then tried to book a restaurant at 11 a.m. for a table for the evening. Full? We understood why when we spent 90 minutes walking round from 5 p.m. to find the first 6 or 7 restuarants closed. Every one of thise had info boards about where was open, info that was nonsense, with different restaurants on each sign, many we'd been to and found shut. The person on the end of the phone number on the signs ( ring and book a table ) told us the names of  open  restaurants, that we'd been to and were shut and seemed to think it was our fault that ones that she had listed as open were shut!! She suggested a hot dog restaurant when we were looking for a meal. We finally were forced to have a  formule . My Lasagne and Garlic bread looked and tasted like they had been reheated numerous times, foul. I took pictures, they were so bad. My collegaue had been to the park on Christmas Day when there were (understandably) significantly less visitors but every restaurant had been open apparently. I have been going to Disneyland in Florida and Paris for many years and this was so unDisney like. I saw numerous people waliking round smoking, unchallenged and there were cigarette tabs on the floor...never seen in Florida. Back to the rides, most of our pupils, seemed to enjoy some rides but ended up going back and forth between a couple because so much was shut. 2 stars, not one? The light show is still magical and those kids who had never been before did get some magic even though most of us who had been before felt sorely short changed. Not sure how many of the 26 kids will be rushing back with families in the future. I'm afraid I won't be even though I am now entering the grandkids phase of vists now",Disneyland_Paris

Know where you want to go (study the map) and take advantage of the fastpass. Our favorite rides: Space Mountain, Pirates, Big Thunder. Bring your own water bottles. Bring sunscreen. Take breaks. One nice break is to ride the train around the park   great to do when it is hot outside and everyone is getting tired. When you take a break, just look around. I want the gardening staff from Disney to take care of my house! Every flower and blade of grass is perfect. The buildings all look freshly painted. The employees (mostly) are nice. It is fun to ask them questions   like do you get to pick the ride you work on. Enjoy every detail, that's what makes it special from other amusement parks.",Disneyland_California

I would recommend any and all attractions.

If you book more than 60 days ahead, mark your calendar to make the dinner reservations on the 60th day before the trip. When you waltz into Blue Bayou ahead of a pack of 50 last minute diners you will be thanking me.Best time to go on rides: the last hour 80 90 percent of the people leave, giving you access to go on your favorite rides over and over and over. Some you can go again without getting off. Ever triple timed Splash Mountain?",Disneyland_California
327498348,5,2015-10-01,United Kingdom,"Came here in October with my wife and two daughters, 5 and 8. We drove down on a Thursday, catching the Shuttle at 10am. The drive from Calais down to Disney was a very easy and relaxed three hours which included a quick stop for the toilets and some drinks. We used the toll roads, which cost about 21 euros but well worth it as the roads are empty.Anyway about the park. It's fantastic and the girls loved it.  I'm going to talk about both Disney and Studios in one go. There are positives and negatives, so let's start with the positives. There are so many rides and attractions, that you always have something to do. And then there are the characters roaming around as well. There are staff everywhere and they are all helpful. There are rides for everyone, and every age. Don't miss Ratatouille   it is brilliant and Buzz is cool too. If you want maximum thrills then Tower Hotel is the one, by far my favourite and the biggest thrill. If you like a roller coaster, then don't miss Rock and Rollercoaster   definitely the best. Space Mountain was a bit of a disappointment by comparison. If you have an early entry pass for Disney then go straight to the Discovery zone as even though you get in early to the park only two zones open early. Take advantage and go straight to Buzz to beat the queues. Talking of which, take advantage of the Fastpass, which helps you beat the queues, but be careful as you can only hold one fast pass at a time, until you are less than one hour to entry time   check the time of the pass before you collect it, as if it is for entry three hours later, then you cannot get another till two hours later.Our girls loved the characters and getting their autographs so it's worth buying an autograph book as soon as you arrive and making sure you take photos of them with characters. Spider Man at the Studios was really good. Look out for characters wandering around as well, particularly at The Studios. We printed the photos and stuck them in the autograph books after and our girls loved it. Now the negatives. Food is not cheap. We bought pre paid vouchers for lunch and snacks which was a bad idea   don't do it. The restaurant choices are very limited and therefore everyone with a voucher is there. I wish we hadn't bothered, and had the flexibility to go where we wanted. Queues for seeing characters take ages so be prepared if you want to do that sort of thing. Don't always believe the queue times as they can be well out of date.To finish, my top tips are as follows:  you must do Tower Hotel, rock and Rollercoaster, Buzzlight year and Ratatouille. Don't buy the food vouchers in advance. Take advantage of early opening. And you must must must must stay for the fireworks and lose show on the castle, it's excellent!! If you have young children then the show starts early on a weekday night. And you don't need to be right at the front, just get a spot in the street leading to the castle.There's a lot more to say, but hope that helps. Please message me if you have any other questions.",Disneyland_Paris

118657397,4,2011-08-01,United Kingdom,"We went there for 4 days spent 3 nights. Arriving on Sunday evening via the Eurostar and TGV and leaving on Wednesday morning in the reverse order. We stopped at the Hotel New York which is well placed from the park about 5 mins walk and was part of the Disney Village. On arrival at the train station at Disneyland it was hard to find the direction of the hotel as there was no visible signs up. We had to wait for the free shuttle bus provided which took a about 30 mins to arrive and was full maybe we had just missed one. At this point it was very hot it was like being in the Caribbean. I wore boots because the weather report said there would be thunderstorms there was none thankfully.Once I checked into the hotel I was given a fast pass for both parks for the duration of my stay. After this it was about 10pm when we made our way to the Disneyland Park just following the crowd and was in a good position to film the Parade and Fireworks. These you can see on youtube http:www.youtube.com watch?v eGDN5ws 3vY and http:  www.youtube.com watch?v  RpVZOZysUc&feature related . The pass allow early entrance to both parks at 8am but in reality in the main park only a few attractions open then, most open at 10am. The Disney Studio didn't seem to open before 9.30am so a pointless allowance. Water is very expensive there and in the village. The cheapest place to get this is at the small shop at the railway station.A major disappointment was the lack of non Disney character shops. There are no chemist nor supermarkets so bring everything you need. The restaurants in the village are very expensive. In short the parks are good but the facilities as mentioned could be better. The Trains were filthy inside, very dirty but the hotel was good.",Disneyland_Paris

The souvineers are overpriced but they'll always remind you of the good times, all the ones I have do. It's ok to splurge a little when you're at the happiest place on earth right? It is always so clean, unlike other theme parks you might go to, the staff is always so accomidating. I've never had a problem with them. Even though they're might be agurments in the group with you, that's life for you but, nothing from the staff.

217145865,3,2014-07-01,Australia,"Be very careful to check if there is a typhoon warning 3 or above as they will close all outdoor rides. Even the ones undercover like teacups, carousel etc. The day we went there was no sign outside nor did the ticket office warn us that since there was a warning of a typhoon this would happen. There was light showers and little to no wind and long moments of blue skies but that did not mean they wouldn't close the rides. We were baffled. The actual typhoon hit around 8pm but they closed the rides 6 hrs earlier than that. With modern technology there is no need for that. Anyone with a smart phone can see the front coming in. This closure meant that every single ride in toy story land was closed. Every single one. The one ride in glitter gulch was closed as well. The river rafts, tarzans tree house closed. Autopia, UFO ride, dumbo closed. The staff really are not efficient and I saw one smile all day. The line for the lion king show is like a football riot. They have a large area that funnels into a smaller area. The pushing and shoving is pretty ridiculous. Just be near the front. Someone said this is cheap. Yes it is by disneyland standards. But it's very small. We rode 5 different rides and we were there from 11 9pm. Also do not eat close to 9pm. They pretty much stop cooking at about 7:30pm.

The park was small enough for us to spend a pleasant day there and feel that we had been able to see enough of it, even though it rained for a few hours and they had to shut down the uncovered rides. We did manage to get on most of the outdoor rides beforehand so it wasn't a problem for us . The theming was lovely, perfect actually. The price of food was reasonable given the sort of place it was. The shows were excellent. The rides were generally not thrilling but a much better option for us than Ocean Park because our five year old was able to accompany us on most of them. He especially enjoyed Space Mountain   his first roller coaster ride ever. This was my first ever visit to a Disneyland so I really loved the Dolls of the World display even though I normally hate the song 'It's a Small World'. It was so beautifully done and each group of dolls added their own cultural flavour to the tune so it didn't get overbearing   the only rendition of it I've ever enjoyed. I really liked the range of souvenirs and thought that they were very reasonably priced.

I have a 13 year old daughter and there wasn't enough for her age level. Sadly Space Mountain was closed due to renovations. The Hollywood Hotel was lovely. Everything you expect from Disney.

Fair enough but the Chinese person behind us just went up and spent the next 1 2 minutes taking pictures with the character. When I questioned the cast member when they allowed that family to take pictures after denying us I got the typical blank stare that I am used to in Shanghai. If you live in China and your kids haven't been to Disney and you don't want to go to any of the other disneys then I guess I would say go. If you have any other choice I would explore it first. If you don't live in the Asia pacific area I would recommend staying away as between how small this Disney is and how rude Asia people can be (its the culture and not a personal thing) I think your vacation time is better spent elsewhere.

We have no objections at all as the PA System was annoucing that regardless of which queue you are in, the waiting time would be the same. My wife happened to join the Manadrin queue unknowingly and we were disapointed to see with our own eyes that the English & Cantonese queues were faster by at least 5 boats ahead of us. I recalled a Thai family who went in the same time with us but boarded 5 boats ahead of us and some who joined in the English queue later boarded the boats before us.

A few years ago we visited Knotts Berry Farm, the bathrooms had been vandalized, many of the rides seemed like they were for teenagers only,it did not seem like the family park I remembered previously. In Disneyland you always feel safe.The new Star Tours was especially fun for all. They changed the old one so that now there are several outcomes for each trip. Toy Story Mania (actually in California Adventure Park)was another favorite, although the rides like Pirates, Big Thunder Mountain, and Space Mountain continue to be popular attractions as well. Food was expensive, but it was always good. Wear good walking shoes, you'll need them. The monorail takes you to downtown Disney where there are some good restaurants.

Main Street USA has very few, if any Western restaurants, most are geared towards the Chinese palette. Space mountain is a great ride, and Small World is great too.

If you are going to Color show, get the dinner package that allows you to not wait int line. That will kill you especially if you have little kids. Take your time and have fun.

Each (land) has only one maybe two rides, most of the show times clash and the food, drink and souvenir prices are way over the top.

We stayed at Kingdom club in Disney hotel so had special entry gate to right end of gate options which made entry quick & easy. Big tip: turn left after going thru entry to start of Main street and go into the information centre (ask for directions at entry gate if unsure). They gave us a program & timetable of where & when the Disney princesses and characters appear for photos and autographs for the day. We got there early each time, minimal queuing and planned our day around the program. We got around the park in 2 days but a 3rd would've been better, or if our 1st day was as well planned as our 2nd day. Don't pack bulky raincoats, we bought some cheap, lightweight ones within a few mins of needing them so save valuable luggage space. Huge range of Pandora Disney Hong Kong pendants, Disney pendants & limited edition ones & Pandora shops all through the park and at Disney hotel, although stock significantly depleted since my wife's onslaught.On shopping, the train station you catch the Mickey mouse train from (to the park) is actually attached to an enormous factory outlet (DFO) store (again, stock depleted as per above). We did struggle to find western food in the park & what we found wasn't good (what's with chicken sausages hotdogs & Pluto pups).Quite a lot of rides were closed on our visit, maybe low season or just bad luck but consider that 3rd day if everything is running. Street parade is great, best spot is between the Disney castle and street as the parade stopped there for quite a while for static entertainment which only a limited number of people saw. Night parade we saw only from Kingdom club verandah but timed to fireworks so worth seeing, our kids were too tired to stay that late. Overall a great experience, worth the trip.",Disneyland_HongKong

584548536,4,2018-05-01,United Kingdom,"When you have kids it can be quite tricky to avoid the things you'd rather avoid. For years we had resisted Disneyland but we realised it was daft to ignore it forever, as our daughter was about the right age to go (6 and a half) . So, we bought two day passes to the parks and hoped for the best.We had glorious weather (blue skies most of the time), the parades were great fun, the rides were mostly brilliant. Ratatouille, Peter Pan's Flight and Buzz Lightyear's Laser Blast were favourites. We used the Fast Pass facility for these, which I would really recommend. Less fun was the Snow White ride, which really scared our normally quite resilient daughter (it was heavily biased towards the Evil Queen, which was bizarre). Best avoided with tinies. We found that the Studio Park emptied out around the time of the parade (5pm) so we were able to just walk onto the rides. Be quick though...we got caught out the following day because we arrived just after it had closed at 6pm.We booked a character lunch which was really quite expensive   however, in the short time we were there we met Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy and Chip. Given that we had already queued to see Mickey for an intensely slow hour and a half without a delicious buffet to eat at the same time, if you like that sort of thing, spend the money. Our daughter was thrilled. If I had any advice: take snacks (avoid getting in a queue for coffee or ice cream because you'll lose the will to live), wear comfy shoes and take a brolly and above all, enjoy it!",Disneyland_Paris
139626302,5,2012-09-01,United Kingdom,"We recently attended Disney's 20th Birthday Celebrations and all I can say is that if you have the opportunity to go, take it!!If you stay on resort you can get in to the park at 8am and stay until the park closes so you really get your money's worth. If you're not staying on resort, and you have tickets to visit both parks, head to Disney Studios first and ride all of the ones that don't have fast passes as this park closes earlier than the main park and it will give you a head start!!If you are fortunate enough to be able to see the Disney Dreams night time show, make sure you are in a prime position at least an hour before it is scheduled to take place.People will appear from everywhere and you will soon have to defend your place for all you are worth!! Watch out for people who will put their children on their shoulders and climb up a bank in front of you!! This is what happened to us   we were so shocked to see that people were climbing all over Disney's carefully manicured gardens to get in a good position and even if you think you are well positioned, please ensure there aren't any potential climbing aids in front of you as other people will use them!!My advice is to stand on the curb in the central plaza facing the castle, there you will get a good view, alternatively, you can stand on the hill by the entrance to Adventureland (but mind for the overhanging branches that could impair any photos you want to take   so stand the other side of them). Also, don't stand too close to the castle, you will lose the effect of the lasers, lights, water cannons and effects   there are some images that are projected on to the 'doorway' of the castle so try to be able to see these but the main spectacle is the effects on and around the castle and you will miss these if you are too close.Be mindful that there is a VIP area by Casey's that they don't rope off until closer to the time and an exclusive wheelchair access only area if you get 'moved on' you will have lost out on obtaining a good vantage point   if you are not sure of the exact position of these, ask a Cast Member beforehand.When it comes to general parades if possible, stand in front of a bin!! They are on the curb side and Disney cast members won't allow you to step off of the curb during a parade so you won't have anyone stood in front of you. Lastly, Disney are currently offering a Disney Dreams Dinner Package, although we didn't do this, (and I'm sure the food is amazing), the vantage point you have from Casey's garden isn't great as you still have people stood in front of you!!",Disneyland_Paris

Went on a Wednesday and there was not much of a queue for tickets at the door. There are cast members watching the queue and directing guests and weeding out queue jumpers! The park has been extended since the original 2006 plan but still you can easily do the whole park in one day by yourself. The park was not busy at all, and I hardly had to queue for anything, except shows and RC racer, which is very popular but has no fast pass. It is the best thrill ride in the park though, so an absolute must! Worth the queue! Space mountain and parachute drop have single rider queues that are very quick. Characters are plentiful, and I got to meet Beymax, which I was so excited about!The other highlights for me were the shows: Mickey's wondrous story book and the Lion King: outstanding performances!!! Definitely make sure you get to see them! For me both shows were not full at all, but make sure you arrive at least ten minutes before show time because they close the doors before the actual show time.Lastly, the parades were cancelled due to bad weather, but HK Disneyland did not disappoint its guests and put out the 'Rainy day parade' with the princesses, Toy story characters and the main gang  with their special raincoats! Jolly good show!The Disney Magic is well and truly alive in Hong Kong! It's not super friendly bordering on cheese Florida nor does it have all the thrills of Paris, but it presents you with entertainment and attractions that the whole family can enjoy, and just as Walt Disney intended, everyone of all ages has a smile on their face : )",Disneyland_HongKong

225810085,5,2014-04-01,Australia,"This was our first trip (and hopefully not last!) to Disneyland with our 8 year old son and it was a magical experience for everyone. Given the expense of travelling here from Australia, we did a fair bit of research beforehand to make sure we knew which rides were operating, which ones we REALLY wanted to go on, which we would like to go on, and which we would go on if we had time and the lines were short. There is so much to see and do that it's impossible to cover everything in 1 day. We still didn't cover everything in 2 days at this park, but at least with a priority list we didn't leave missing out on anything we really wanted to do. The only exception was the Flying Dumbo ride which never had a wait time of less than 1 hour.The attention to detail is AMAZING, and everything is very well organised. If we could offer any advice from our experience it would be to:1) Arrive early to maximise your time.2) Plan ahead, do what you really, really want first.3) Wear comfortable shoes, you'll cover plenty of area. We averaged 25,000 steps per day!4) Take note of the waiting times. These vary during the day and to maximise our time elsewhere we avoided lines if the wait time was over 30 minutes. 5) Use FastPasses when possible",Disneyland_California
303365723,3,2015-08-01,United Kingdom,"We booked a three day break in Disneyland Paris. My husband has been to the USA parks and I have been to Eurodisney with my kids 12  years ago. It didn't seem as magical this time and some parts looked tired with  a small world  being refurbished into 2016, some areas closed off and some parts boarded off. The queues for the rides were ridiculously long for the length of time you were on them and queues didn't really seem very organised. Staff in the shops were pleasant enough and some were friendly but the ones on the rides and in the park generally did not smile. It's Disney, what's not to smile about?! We queued for an hour to use the train which again was chaotic. The staff didn't speak or acknowledge you and on one occasion, the train was about to leave the station and several carriages had not had their doors closed. Luckily one of the staff spotted it and managed to stop the train   consequences of this could have been quite disastrous as there were children in all carriages. Still no smile from the staff! As Disney is a business, perhaps there should be staff morale training in customer service, see how USA do it and match it. The food at Disney is basic. Each place had different set menus and as long as you like fast food then you would be ok. It was over priced for what you get as having had a meal at Planet Hollywood, we certainly got better value for money there. Drinks are also extortionately over priced but as a captive audience, you had no choice. We took a bottle of squash and bought water, worth it when the weather is so warm.There seem to be a lot more shops than I remember, clearly aiming for parents grandparents to spend the money   make sure you take plenty as it doesnt last!This summer they are promoting Frozen with a parade which was Horse and carriage with Elsa and Anna   that was it. I think the size of Frozen they could have made more of it which was a shame. The 5.30pm parade was lovely and all the characters were out in force, well worth the wait. The park had notices of what time it closed and we sat for over an hour waiting for the firework display to no avail. Quite a few people got up and left as we did on the first night as sitting on a concrete floor isnt great! The second night we waited til the last minute to watch them but it was a very long day getting back to the hotel well after midnight.Overall, we had a pleasant three days but t was certainly long enough. There wasn't enough to keep us there any longer and I would think twice about going again, perhaps save for the USA experience.",Disneyland_Paris

302303026,4,2015-08-01,United States,"My party consisted of 5 adults, 1 teen and 1 kid. My sister has done Disney World in FLA 28 times since 1985. My 16 year old niece has done it 20 times since 2000. They both LOVE Disney World. I tried to tell them Disneyland was not comparable but my niece insisted on it for her birthday. Both of them had a blast! Disneyland is less crowded and has some attractions Disney World does not. My sister was also awed by its location to so many hotels within walking distance.She is a master at timing rides and fast passes so we were able to do everything we wanted (and some duplicates) in one day. A family who prefers to wing it should plan on at least two days. The Paint the Night Parade lasts 15 minutes and is spectacular. We waited for the midnight show and had a great vantage point near the entrance gates. Get your spot about 45 minutes beforehand. The earlier show is cram packed so do the late one if you can.Disneyland is expensive so I rate everything on  value.  If you or someone in your family loves Disney then it's a good value. You'll get a kick out of seeing the wonder in your kids' eyes. But be prepared to spend a small fortune. You are allowed to carry totes and back packs into the park and ours were filled with snacks and bottled water. This beats spending scads of money on Disney food. Every ride has either a place on the ride to stow backpacks totes or has storage cubes outside the ride. Don't listen to anyone who says Splash Mountain doesn't get you  that wet.  All 7 of us were soaked and I mean head to toe, socks, shoes, underwear, the whole nine yards.Honestly, I deducted a circle because I find more vacation dollar value doing something else. I know that's a personal thing but I tried to consider the  average family  viewpoint in my review and I think it's a lot of money for what you get by the time you add up the tickets, hotel, food, souvenirs, etc. Wheelchairs can be rented for $17 per day and motorized scooters for $54.",Disneyland_California

This is a wonderful combination of East meets West. I had dim sum pork ribs over sticky rice with sauce (yum!). My husband and friend each had the fish n' chips which came with French fries, tarter sauce, ketchup and a bowl of creamy mushroom soup. There were also veggies on the side. I had my husband's soup and it wad very rich and creamy, not watery at all! I can't say if their food was good or not as they both ate every bite before I could taste it. We later had hot buttered Carmel popcorn (which you can ask to have  to go  and they will wrap it in a bag for you). This never made it out of the park as intended: we couldn't stop eating it! It is better than the way we do it in the States! I had chocolate covered, black sesame ice cream that was marvelous and Dole dark chocolate dipped banana slices also delightful! Two food misses: mango pudding: no taste; odd texture. Circle donut: wonder white bread with glaze over the top (and we all agreed it looked so good!). Full fruit juice lived up to the name: watermelon and mango, but lots and lots of sugar. Try Healthworks by Nestles. It is a sugarcane and sea coconut drink (looks like Vitamin Water). It's different, but tasty! Not for he timid!",Disneyland_HongKong

628968085,5,2018-10-01,United Kingdom,"My 5th time at disney (2nd with a child) and it still hasn   t lost it   s magic. This was my first Halloween experience and I loved it! Top tips for those with under 6   s. Hire a stroller! We took our own with us without realising they hired them out at the park. Watch the parade at the roundabout in front of the castle (pitch up 1hr before hand with a picnic for best views) or at the very end of the parade by the band stand at the bottom of main street. You can sit down and have an unobscured view from the pavement. (The spot by the band stand is right next to the toilets too so bonus!)  Get the app! It tells you times for shows etc and waits for rides. Plus, it tells you what attractions are closed for refurb. Most of what we would have been able to access with a 4 year old in the Disney Studios was closed so we didn   t bother going there and saved money by purchasing a day pass for the magic kingdom. Save money on souvenirs and find the characters who give out    free    gifts. Bring activities to do in the queue if you have a smaller child who can   t tolerate waiting. Adjust eating times slightly by having an early lunch so as to avoid queues. Bring a refillable bottle and use the water fountains throughout the park. Head to the pirates ship in adventure land to let your kids run around and burn off steam at the play park. If you are in a hotel outside of the park   save time by buying the park tickets at your hotel. A great photo opp: go to the top of sleeping beauty   s castle and head to the back. There is a balcony which overlooks fantasy land. If you have a member of your party standing at the bottom, they can look up and get a great photo of you! Need shade or rain cover? Head to adventure land, the Swiss family Robinson tree or one of the many cavernous areas next to the pirate ship.",Disneyland_Paris

243249566,4,2014-12-01,United Kingdom,"Just back from a few days with my family here.. I have a teenager and a 1 yr old. What can I say about disney that has not already been said? Not much. It was everything and more. Even the freezing cold did not dampen the mood. My only criticism do disneyland and it's surroundings are the food. Not a single vegetable can be found. It's either burgers, chips or anything else than can be fried. That's ok once or twice but every day is to much. I felt quite sick after a few days of fatty food. I have never looked forward to seeing a carrot so much. I will say that when you go it is so expensive. A cup of tea sets you back   2, a hat about   15, 3 bottles of coke   10. This is the only thing that spoilt the place if I am honest. I was also slightly disappointed at the lack of characters and the fact many of the food halls and attractions were not running as it was  out if season  however the first week of December it was extremely busy, maybe not as busy as summer months but busy all the same.",Disneyland_Paris

On my trip here last week I stumbled across the ONLY wall plug in i found in the whole park so I could avoid paying the $30 and just do a quick 30 min charge. It can be found on the right side of the street, near the lockers, as you're coming in the gate and passing all the little shops. Specifically, it can be found on the wall of the  Painless Dentist  office (not a real store) across the path from Starbucks (real store). So... Save your $30 and bring your wall charger!

The lands have unique experiences and rides that are different. We really enjoyed the French quarter. I just live disney and the California and venture park was just as cool. I love that its condense and you don't have to take a bus or monorail every where to enjoy yourself. The experience was magical and well worth the time to compare.

The park is beautiful and the characters look so real you cannot stop yourself from waiving at them!Recommend to stay in a disney hotel due to distance and easy to get there at 8 am  before everybody else to go on the rides and get the characters autographs without having to queue too long. After 6 pm is quieter too :)I would love to go back. There is so much to do!Oh I highly recommend the Frozen sing a long! That show is very colourful and full of life.

456546480,5,2017-01-01,United States,Yes it is the happiest place on earth. great for old or young. if you are visiting the west coast don't miss this. Disney world is bigger but 98% the same thing. so whatever one is closer to you is the best for you. Even though the place was built in 1955 everything is kept in new condition. They are always updating and maintaining. Wear your best walking shoes and plan to leave exhausted. Show up early for breakfast with the characters and leave after the fireworks late. your kids wont leave until they are ready to pass out anyway. You won't be able to do everything in two days. and many rides will be good for a 2nd 3rd of 4th time. So plan 3 or 4 days. split those days up with one or two days at California Adventure making a trip to Anaheim at least 3 and as many as 5 days on the parks. Tips:1. Look for deals on the DL website that include hotels and entry tickets. 2. Prepaying for meals is cheaper than paying throughout the days. 3. Make reservations at some eating places days in advance.4. Don't expect to drive home after a day in DL or CA. you are going to be too tired. Stay one more night off property and drive home the next day. 5. Probably do the same coming in on the 1st day. Get an off property room the night before and get up at 6:30 for the early park entry and character breakfast.,Disneyland_California

The two parks are only a few steps away from each other unlike WDW, no transportation needed! I love how everything is condensed into 2 Parks as opposed to 4 at WDW. The rides are similar to Magic Kingdom with a few different ones thrown into the mix, such as the Matterhorn and Nemo's Submarine Voyage, just to name a few. Star Wars has also taken over Tomorrow land, so if you're a fan, you'd absolutely love it. The fireworks and parades are nothing short of amazing!

We were only able to ride 4 rides for a whole day because of the lines being extremely long!

168526504,3,2013-07-01,Singapore,"HK Disneyland pales in comparison to Japan's Disneyland but the staff were very versatile in their linguistic skills hence they were very helpful to us. The rides are more family oriented thus it will not be as thrilling as universal studio's rides.This is my 2nd time to HK Disneyland. It was crowded when it was first opened and it was understandable. This time round, I went on a Monday, not expecting any crowd during the off peak period but I had to wait up to 30 to 45 mins for many rides. i also had many terrible experiences in the Disneyland as the tourists were really very rude. They nudge and bump into people inconsiderately, holding no reins on their children who modeled the adults' behaviours. The worst of all, is when tourists came up to the shopping basket that I am holding, to shop for the things that they want to get from my selections. No, I was not dressed up like any Mickey Mouse or anyone alike to the Disneyland staff to warrant for such rudeness.I would say that Disneyland is still a great place for families and kids but my advice to interested tourists is to avoid peak holiday period as the experience of the company whom you hang out with in the place of interest makes a huge impact to your traveling memory.",Disneyland_HongKong

The food quality is very poor especially as it   s expensive.    12 for a cold burger, fries and drink ! The restaurants outside the park are better but service is still slow.

So I was very surprised to walk right up to the boats of It's a small world, without even standing in line. (On a Saturday) This goes for all the other rides also. Luckily we rode all the rides before 2 pm. At 2 pm, mobs and mobs of people came streaming in. Not sure if there was a special event? But from that point on, lines were 40 min or longer. Also, it was fun collecting stickers from the Disney employees. (That's something they don't do at Anaheim.) It is smaller than Anaheim, but being able to NOT wait in line before 2 pm made the whole experience worth it. And it was so easy to get there via MTR. Also, we were able to get on the first MTR train we walked up to after exiting the park, after the fireworks. They must be very efficient. WIth so many people exiting, I was expecting a long wait for a train. Also bring mosquito repellent. I was bitten a lot within 15 min. of entering the park, and I noticed I wasn't the only one.

We try not to compare this to Florida as it is very very small but the cast members really do need to take notice of the Florida staff, no Disney 'magic' from them, miserable, verging on rude, such a shame. Long long queue to get in the park due to the bag checks which take far too long. The park is very small but has some of the best Disney rides. It's a small world was closed, such a shame as probably one of the most popular. Pirates of Caribbean was good but the photo was blurred and the girl told us the camera wasn't working properly, if that was the case why let us queue up forever to buy it when it was no good. Parade was a disappointment as only 3 floats! No evening parade. Not that many characters running about for photo opportunities but saw a few. The shops are good with plenty of stock in them and lots to buy, funny how they can get that right. Not many toilets around (again need to clean their act up, literally) and a shortage Of cold drinks vendors around the park. We had VIP fast passes but not all rides had fast pass and so quite a bit of waiting in line. Smoking is an issue, with people smoking everywhere even in food queues, not really appropriate with so many children around. It was a beautiful day, hot sunshine which made it a good day out in general. Although it is a small park it could be a lot better, don't confuse the experience with WAlt Disney World in Florida with its 4 theme parks, magic and smiles all the way.",Disneyland_Paris

We only spent 1 day in the park as this was enough.I took my 3 daughters, one is severely disable and uses a wheelchair, but can transfer out with support.I expected, once I had a  priority  green card that we would be able to go on rides without queuing, ie usually via the exit with potentially a short wait of up to 15 mins or so. How wrong!!! On all of the main rides that my daughter was able to get on, ALL of them had a  reservation  system in place. This meant that after going to the exit, we were told that we had to make a reservation (sometimes having to go back to the start!) and come back later. This ranged from 2 hours to 4 hours!!! We only arrived at the park after midday, and after looking around, viewing parades etc we only started to go to rides then. We were not told about this at City Hall. So when we arrived at Pirates of the Carribean at 4:50pm, we were told to come back at 8:30pm!!! I found this totally insane and hardly priority for disabled visitors. I complained at City Hall and they were unhelpful. I filled in a complaint form, and intend to write a strongly worded letter. This was our first and last visit to Disneyland Paris. I also found a lot of the staff sullen, rude and unhelpful. (Not all) It certainly was not a  magical  experience for our family and we were extremely disappointed with our visit. It was also a lot smaller than imagined and a lot if the focus was on up selling food drink and Disney stuff.The rides we did get on were frankly average and I can only imagine peoples disappointment at having to wait 1 2 hours to get on some.

414089027,4,2016-08-01,Indonesia,"This was my first Disneyland, and it was magical. Well, not really. I visited Disneyland just because I thought it was an obligation as a tourist in Hong Kong to visit Disneyland. Well, I chose a wrong day to visit. I went on Sunday morning when most of people were visiting Disneyland, in general I spent at least 20 minutes for a ride. The place was super crowded, but still manageable. Since it was summer, then you can imagine the heat. It was super hot. So prepare yourself additional t shirt and lots of water so you can refresh your self. Basically, all the rides were built for children and teenager. So for adult, you'll feel that all the rides were lame. But, for me as a non adrenaline junkie, this place was okay. As for the heat, you can always walk or wait your friends inside every store. Since there were so many Disney store in every ride, so you can hide and chill a little bit. They also have several restaurant and food stalls inside. And if you're a Muslim visitor, they also have a nice and proper prayer room inside. It is located in Mystic Point (if I was not wrong), just right next to the restroom. As I noticed, that not so many people know about this facility, since there was no one inside when I was there for more than 30 minutes.Overall, this place was worth to visit. But please consider the timing. Just avoid weekend, and public holidays. And one more thing, we're never too old for Disneyland. So, enjoy the magical moment.",Disneyland_HongKong

Admittedly we only had 4 rides (Grizzly Mine car and Space Mountain are the best) and ignored all the shows. It all depends on whether you have young children with you or not. We did not but decided to visit to say that at least we had been there. Our impression was that it would be great for a family with young children. You could spend hours on all the rides and shows. For us there were too many shops and as usual you were locked in to buying what they wanted you to eat and drink. As you enter your bags are searched to ensure that apart from a bottle of water for each person   no food or other drinks are brought in. Food quality was OK and reasonably tasty. Cleanliness was as expected and there are plenty of places to sit. Somer quite long waits for rides so suggest you get a ticket to return later. There are a lot of sedate rides for those that don't care to shout and scream as the gravity rises and falls in some of the faster rides (aforesaid Grizzly and Space mountain rides!). A small thing but for a theme park I would have expected more staff would understand english. Take a hat though as it can get quite hot standing in the sun waiting in a queue.

There's all the classic rides, shows, characters, and random entertainment like marching bands and barbershop quartets. I just love how they go above and beyond to make visitors excited. The Fast Pass really makes getting certain rides into your visit done. Rather than spending a whole hour in line, you can get a Fast Pass and do something else and come back to the front of the line. But not all rides have it, so you will end up waiting. None of the rides in Fantasy Land have this feature, and the line to Peter Pan is almost always and hour wait. I was there for four days hoping to catch that ride at a time when it wasn't so long. There truly isn't a time when it isn't long.Any churro around the world will never be as good as the one you get at Disneyland. They always have the best, so my family and I ate a lot of then. But eating at Disneyland can be VERY expensive. Every time me and my two kids ate a meal there, it would cost over $40. Not joking. Be smart and bring in prepared sandwiches and bottles of water. They allow that. If you buy a pass for 3 or more days, you will get one Magic Morning Hour day that can be used on a Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday. This doesn't really help all that much unless you go wait in line at the gate at about 7:00 (park usually opens at 9:00 but Magic Morning Hour lets you in at 8:00). So many people have this same privilege that the park seems just as crowded. Also, Adventure Land, Frontier Land, and Critter Country are closed during this time so you are limited to Tomorrow Land and Fantasy Land, which accounts for why it still seems crowded. Fast Pass doesn't work during this hour either.Just try to plan ahead, save a lot of money because souvenirs and food are expensive, and get a smartphone app that lets you see the wait times for attractions at the park. You'll be fine.",Disneyland_California

548524499,2,2017-12-01,United States,"me, my daughter and grandkids went to disney on a regular day and there was overcrowded so the handling of the people is done by the employees directing the traffic which are very rude nowadays and yelled at everybody as they push people to be just in one corner to see a show. First of all, disney has to look for a way to handle the crowds with respect and care as before. Second of all, is unsafe to be 500 people in just one little corner in case of an emergency Third, they have to stop giving preference to people who pay for fast passes is not fair for people who can hardly pay for one day ticket to be treated as third class citizen because they did not know that the fast pass tickets had to be bought in advance.",Disneyland_California

497532122,4,2016-07-01,United Kingdom,"Having been to Orlando a few times and experienced a choice of great Disney theme parks I was a little disappointed with Disneyland, California.Saying that I think if you haven't been to the Orlando parks then this a must if you are holidaying in the area!Going in July it was busy as expected & even getting a meal would take a lot longer than I hoped.I love Universal but Disney probably caters to a wider age range while Universal isn't great for really young kids.Ticket prices here for 1 day for a non resident are getting a little silly this isn't a cheap day out! I wont be in a rush to go back until the new Star Wars stuff is done as that does look like its going to be amazing!",Disneyland_California
286123953,5,2015-01-01,Ireland,"Our 3 year old loved disneyland Hong Kong. The train going there even has Mickey Mouse shaped windows!! The parade during the day was excellent and had Mickey Mouse as the star attraction. The kids can meet Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse ,Donald Duck etc just after the park in a designated area.we just stumbled across it...no need to pre book.i don't know who was more excited when my kid met Mickey Mouse! The night parade is great.....it had lightening McQueen from cars and Mack and all the usual Disney characters.lots of restaurants dotted around. The only negative is the long waiting times to go on the rides and they don't run for very long.maybe 1 minute. Well worth a visit.",Disneyland_HongKong
433969677,4,2016-10-01,United States,"So we are very, very seasoned Disney travelers! We travel to WDW regularly, but had yet to visit Disneyland and California Adventure. So we made the trek across the country and I'm glad we did it at least once!First the biggest disappointments   we did magic hours and they only open to sections of the park   total waste of time and money! No classic Mickey Ears ice cream at either of the parks! Tried to get an ornament personalized from our trip and they don't offer it until November and no one could even give me an idea of when. Staff was not as outgoing as the WDW parks   it was just different and my husband and I noticed that most of the staff seemed to be local to Cali. I'm not saying they were rude, but they were not inclined to make anything magical. Was kind of sad! :(Things we loved! It was great showing my boys the first castle. I grew up with Disneyland and hadn't been there since I was about 16   so this was a fun trip. They loved the Matterhorn and Indiana Jones ride (both not at WDW). And they loved the usual faves that had a different twist   Haunted Mansion and Space Mountain. We overall enjoyed the visit. Happy we did it at least once!!!",Disneyland_California
118606398,4,2011-09-01,United States,"Our 4th time in 4 years. We are from PA but travel to CA because we find this Disney so much easier to navigate than Florida. Our kids are 5 & 8. We usually come mid Sept. Perfect. The weather is hot but not boiling, you can still swim, and ride water rides but not be too hot. The park is all decorated for Fall Halloween   fun! It was busy but not over whelming crowded. We love it! Cast members wonderful. Do Fast Pass, its worth it. Food was good. We did Big Thunder Bar b que for lunch; a little more money but its all decorated for fall and its nice to take a break and sit down, food was good, all you can eat. Must do rides are NEW STAR Tours (do first), Space Mountain, Big Thunder railroad, Jungle Cruise, Pirates was closed (Bummer!), Splash Mountain, Matterhorn. My only 2 complaints are this: Park opened at 10:00 and closed at 8:00. I wish it would have opened maybe at 9:00 and closed more like 10:00. A few more hours would have been nice and not as rushed. Also watch if you are in park at dark. The main street area is well lighted but all others are DARK. My son fell on a curb that was very hard to see. They need to lighten up the rest of park after dark. Ate also at Mexican restaurant (great food and nice atmopshere!) Stayed on site for first time this year at Paradise Pier   great stay (see seperate review for that). Didnt have problems with line cutting, everyone friendly and happy to be there!

342743640,5,2015-08-01,Finland,"This is an amazing amusement park! So many nice rides, for people in different ages! You should book tickets for two days if you can because the park is huge and you want to see almost everything! Because the park is big you need good shoes for walking.. Eating inside the park is of course very expensive, so I suggest you to eat outside park, there you can find McDonald's, Starbucks and places like that.",Disneyland_Paris

291936928,5,2015-07-01,United States,"Disneyland was much easier than Disneyworld because the scale is much more human sized, you can get places quickly and the vintage rides are beautiful and great for small kids  REALLY enjoyed this.

118943133,5,2011-10-01,United States,"We bought four day tickets and wished we had one more day in the parks.  The attractions are the best, the park is immaculate and everyone is very professional.  Disney knows how to do it right.",Disneyland_California
266506169,4,2015-04-01,United States,"OK. You've read through all the reviews saying how awesome this place is, with the caveat that it is expensive. I've been a big fan of Disney World having been there about six times for 5 6 days each time, and have now had a chance to really evaluate Disneyland. Disneyland is MUCH smaller, and therefore has less to see   but it is much easier to navigate and get from place to place. Once inside the park, you can easily walk anywhere without the exhaustion you get at Disney World. I think it is a better place for people with small children and for older people with some mobility limitations. The rides are similar   not exactly the same   but just as good. Adjacent to Disneyland Park is California Adventure   which is also within easy walking distance and has a different feel and different rides   some if which are similar to Animal Kingdom or Disney Hollywood Studios rides in Disney World. It also has a  Boardwalk  themed area (reminiscent of the Boardwalk in Disney World next to the Beach Club and Yacht Club Hotels) with a great rollercoaster. I found Disneyland just as enjoyable as Disney World   but less exhausting. If you go in mid week at a time of year that is not too crowded, one could easily see both parks in two long days. We spent four days   and it gave us a chance to go back to favorite rides, get on rides that were closed or too crowded, and see quieter attractions. But, there is the cost. If you stay off site you can save some money, but then you have the hassle of getting to the park and parking early so you can get in when the park opens. And, you do not have the ability to take advantage of the fact that the parks open an hour early for people staying in the Disney hotels. The Disney Hotels are very expensive   especially the Grand Californian   which is practically in the park itself. Park passes are expensive. Meals are very expensive. Most things are two times more expensive as in a large city, or four times as expensive as in a non tourist destination. So, a $14.99 adult buffet can cost $40.00 per adult. A hotel room that would cost $130 elsewhere can cost $250 400 night. A scoop of ice cream costs $4.50 in the park, $3 for a bottle of water. And, then there are the park passes   which cost $55 100  day for an adult, and about half that for kids. My issue is that you are often not paying to get something; you are paying to avoid something. And, what you are paying for is not guaranteed in any way. You stay in a hotel to get in early to avoid the crowds. You pay exorbitant amounts for meals in the park to avoid having to go elsewhere and lose the time in the park that you have paid for with your park pass. As for guarantees: the hotels will not guarantee a specific room configuration. The hotel pools have inadequate seating, so you are not guaranteed a spot by the pool. The popular restaurants get booked up quickly, and if you haven't planned ahead you are not guaranteed to get in. And, once you get in the park you are not guaranteed to get on the rides you want. Even though you may have planned your trip a year in advance, and planned on certain rides being available, they can close them at any time. We found many, many rides closed while we were there. You can find that they let so many people in the park that you can only get on a couple of rides in the afternoon because the lines are too long. You can plan on getting FASTPASSES for rides, only to find that the FASTPASS machines are broken (many were broken when we were there). You can go to restaurants, only to find that they are full. I've always had a good time at Disney Parks   because I've planned head, researched strategies, and stayed in Disney Hotels. But, a vacation shouldn't have to be like that. You should be able to walk into a Disney Hotel knowing that you will have the room configuration you need; go to the pool and know you'll be able to sit down; go to the park and be able to relax and enjoy it. Unfortunately, you can't. My advice is to: 1  plan everything ahead as best you can, understanding that your favorite ride just may be closed (near your arrival the date, you can check the Disney web site for the  refurbishment schedule ). When you get to the park, go on your favorite rides first. Get FASTPASSES when you can. 2  plan to do whatever you can to get into the park early, and leave the park when it becomes too crowded to enjoy. Consider coming back later in the evening (but the crowds may not thin out much at busy times).3  mentally prepare yourself to spend a lot more than this is worth. You're doing it for your kids. They have you over a barrel. Just go with it.4  stay in a Disney Hotel, if you can. That extra hour in the morning may be your best part of the trip. And, make sure you get the kids up and use it!5  there are web sites that predict crowd levels. Go at a less crowded time of year, even if you have to pull the kids from school. If you do this, you can probably get away with a much shorter visit to Disney   thus saving time, money and aggravation. Two days at Disneyland will work if you do this.6  Never go to a character breakfast; the kids won't eat, and it keeps you out of the park during those valuable early hours. Have food in the hotel room for breakfast, wolf some down, and get into the park early. Downtown Disney has a Starbucks open at 5:00 am, and La Brea Bakery has great coffee opening at 7:30 am.7  if you want to be able to sit down and relax at lunch or dinner, reservations are imperative. At Disneyland things are close enough together, and you can physically get to a meal in either park or the Disney hotels, or Downtown Disney very quickly. (You cannot do this in Disney World)So, yes. Go to Disneyland. But plan ahead.",Disneyland_California

651275496,4,2018-10-01,United States,"We always love coming to DL as we are Wdw passholders and DVC members. It is smaller and quaint compared to Magic Kingdom. This time it was the first time we were able to use Maxpass. It is an extra charge 15.00 I believe. But so worth it! It allowed us to get on the rides we wanted first thing and pick another pass before the other one came up. Difference is that you have to be in the park for it to work. Not like the free fast passes at Wdw that you pick before you arrive. We felt it made it much more attainable to get passes for too rides. We just had a day this trip, we love Haunted Mansion and got to see it with the Nightmare before Christmas layover. Love it! The Castle is so pretty , it would be great to take kids to see DL first then go to Wdw to see the reaction to the bigger castle.

269623822,3,2014-08-01,France,"I went there to to look at it, without intention of taking any of the rides. It is a typical Disney park, with a lot of attractions, but crowds are very big and lines for most attraction very long.",Disneyland_HongKong
212835419,5,2014-06-01,United States,"We hit all the major rides on a Saturday with relatively short lines, although we did use the Fast Pass a couple of times. We went on 17 rides during the day, some more than once. The sign for the Matterhorn, for example, said we had a 35 minute wait in line. Try 20 minutes instead. Cast members were friendly and accommodating, and there was just a great atmosphere. (Hoping Finding Nemo and Space Mountain open again soon.)Lunch at the French Market was delicious if a little pricey for a group of seven, but the red beans and rice dish and the mint juleps were spot on, and two jazz bands played during our meal. We discovered too late  too full!  that they have a special window at the French Market where you can buy beignets and hot chocolate, just like you get at the Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans. Next time!Everyone was worn out by the end of the day  my pedometer says I walked more than 6 miles  but that was a good thing. Enjoy this wonderful treasure built by Walt Disney with your friends and family. I've been coming since I was 3 years old. The only thing I remember from then is the hippos on the jungle cruise.

253377394,3,2015-02-01,United States,"I should start by saying that I am a fan of the Disney parks in the U.S. and have been to Disneyland dozens of times over several decades, and have also visited each of the parks at DisneyWorld, with the exception of the water parks. Disney has a reputation or the magic it creates and for how clean the parks are. We were expecting this at the parks in France as well, but it was not the case. The two parks are close together and it is easy to walk from one to the other to  park hop , and everything within both parks is relatively compact. There was far less walking than we were used to. We entered Disneyland Park first and headed straight for Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril, which was closed due to the cold weather. Apparently, since it was  2degrees Celsius, the track had frozen, but the attraction did open later in the day. It is nothing like the Indiana Jones ride we are used to. This one is a rollercoaster with a loop that goes upside down. Our next stop was Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. The line said it would take 30 minutes, but it ended up taking over an hour. Inaccurate queue times turned out to be more common than we were used to, and most of the time, they underestimated the time it would take. We had gotten fast passes, but the attraction had a  technical difficulty  while in the Fast Pass line to ride again, so we weren't able to do so. Our third stop was the Phantom Manor, which is similar to our Disneyland's Haunted Mansion, but has different scenes, some of which may be scarier to young children. This ride also stopped for about 20 minutes while we were on it, and they turned all of the lights on. It kind of ruined the Disney magic. Based on our luck, we decided to head to the other park and try some of the attractions that are not available in the U.S. parks. We returned later and things seemed to be working better. We were able to ride several other attractions with no additional technical difficulties. We never made it to Fantasyland, as they closed it about an hour before the park closes so set up for the Disney Dreams show, which happens at park closing and is viewed on the castle. It was one of the highlights of the visit and I would highly recommend staying for it. when running, the attractions were just as much fun as they are at the other Disney parks. One of the biggest things we noticed was the amount of trash all over Disneyland, especially in the queues. There was a lack of trash cans available during the queues and people seem to just drop there trash everywhere. In the U.S. parks, this is cleaned up regularly by any  cast member  who spots it, and Disney has a reputation for how clean the parks are. Not so in France. We also saw cigarette butts everywhere. Apparently, in the queues outdoors, it is acceptable to smoke and many people do. They smoke all over the park. There did not appear to be any designated smoking sections like in the U.S. This is a cultural difference to be aware of if the cigarette smoke will be problematic, but at a minimum, Disney should provide ash trays if smoking is allowed. For the most part, restrooms were clean, except at the end of the night. At that time, we also noticed trash cans were overflowing. This lack of cleanliness was disappointing for a Disney park, but about typical for many other amusement parks.",Disneyland_Paris

It is difficult to stand in the hot sun and watch multiple people try to figure out what is going on. Our kids are older but I felt sorry for the families with young children. The staff at the rides themselves did their best to soothe feelings but the fact that it was many rides going down, not just one or two, was frustrating, especially when you com from far away and can't return soon. Also, while staff were friendly the personal 'make the experience magical for every guest' customer service that made other companies seek to emulate Disney in the past was not strong this time around.",Disneyland_California

618961957,5,2018-09-01,United Kingdom,"Went with wife for a 3 day break to the park. In the 3 days we had plenty of time to do all the rides and watch the fireworks twice at the end of two days before closing. We both love Disney so we enjoyed everything the park has to offer! Our favourite ride is the big thunder mountain roller coaster as it a good thrill roller coaster. My wife doesn't do ride which go upside down so Hyperspace mountain and Indiana Jones I rode by myself. I found queing as a single rider you did get on the ride quicker even if there wasn't a designated single rider. We was gutted that Phantom Manor was shut for construction, when we booked it the website said it would be open by the time of the visit but they extended the date :(.Food wise there is plenty of choice and different style returants e.g. counter or table service. We ate a few times at Casey's corner (hotdogs mainly) for both of us it usually came to roughly    25. We had half board meal plan so we had lunch dinner at Plaza Gardens, it gives a good range of grub ranging from salad, pizza, hot dogs, rice and many desserts. I believe without the meal plans it was around    35 per guest.The cost of everything it what you would expect in a Disney park, so all the gift shops down main street will be a little pricy some better than others. We brought 4 Mickey glass tumblers around    5 each. Later that day we brought two musical snowglobes around    40 each and these were the cheaper ones.We did find it irritating that some other guests didn't have similar etiquette with queing. Felt unfair waiting for a while then having guests push through but this is just a culture thing, didn't let this ruin our fab time. As with most Disney breaks it's important to pace yourself (I can admit I am terrible at this) because these parks are so overwhelming and fast paced it really takes it out of you. Thank you for having us and we will definitely be returning in the future again.",Disneyland_Paris

My four year old granddaughter was enchanted   but no more so than was I.Of course there were queues for the attractions   but the queues were brilliantly handled by skilful staff.

Don't miss seeing  Fantasmic,  the spectacular pyrotechnic show in Frontierland that lasts for about twenty two minutes. It's really a  must see.  TIP: If, after a day of rides and wonder, you feel that you would rather be seated while watching  Fantasmic  instead of standing several rows deep along the river's edge, you may want to explore getting seated on the terrace of the River Belle Terrace Restaurant. The terrace provides great views of the show's action and sits up higher than the people standing below near the river.

The only Disney magic is that that you create yourself   it was seriously lacking. I did expect it to be busy but it was heaving. The late night parade and show were positively dangerous despite staff trying to keep order   i suppose its a financial thing  cutbacks mean less staff. Most of the staff lacked any enthusiasm anyway and didn' t keep any order so people pushed and shoved   very rude. All queuing signage was very very inaccurate   the first ride we tried said 15 mins and it was actually over an hour. The staff were just not paying attention and organising things. The toilets were disgusting   everyone i went in even in the morning they smelt. Food was ok but very expensive and again service was just not organised so queueing was a pain. I personally wouldn't go back again   its just not Disney any more its commercialise disappointment.,Disneyland_Paris

My 70 year old mother trip in the park and cut open her knee and hit her wrist. Maxine, one of the park cleaners saw her and was ready to assist at any cost. We appreciated both employees help and accommodation. We have be to the Disney Parks in California and Florida BUT PARIS is definitely at the top in regards to customer service!!! The American parks should take heed of the example that the Parisians show. Despite the large amount of people visiting all the lines seemed to move and things continued smoothly. Recommend  Its a small world  &  Pirates of the Caribbean  if you want a fresh twist to the ones at the other parks! This parks keeps the Disney classics alive in my opinion. Bambi is still featured here!!! Frozen characters was not the complete focus. There was a Mary Poppins show, one could take a picture with Winnie the Pooh and many Alice in Wonderland features!

There was never a moment where you had nothing to do. The best thing was that you could go on the same ride 3 or 4 times one after the other. The que wasn't that bad to get on a ride. Even though there were loads of people it was still the best trip i have been on. I liked that there were restaurants as well so you could have fun and also go for something to eat. My favourite ride was thunder mountain. I would definitely go back again and you can go with anyone because it suits all the family and when your with friends its great as well because you all go on the same rides.

A magic place.It pays to do a little research if you have not been before to make sure you understand how things like the Fast Pass work and also what the different rides are as to whether they are suitable for young children or not. That way you an make the most of your time. Also good to read the weekly programme guides to pick up some of the special events that are on that week.,Disneyland_California
218300238,3,2014-07-01,United States,My biggest concern were the number of rides that went down in the two days we were there.Some for less than an hour and others for over an hour. Knott's Berry Farm didn't have these problems during the two days we were there.,Disneyland_California

346804964,2,2016-02-01,Germany,"Kids had a good time, but it was below expectations. Meeting the characters is way too challenging, they shouldn't issue those autograph books if you need to queue 35 minutes to get a single autograph. The light   firework show is cool if you can stay that late. The parade is OK. It just felt really dated, the star wars ride is really old technology I thought with all the start wars mania they would have something cutting edge. Have never been to Florida but everyone we met said there is no comparison.",Disneyland_Paris

Went over to California Adventure to see  Holiday Cheer .. NOT!!! The parade was  Gay Parade  music blasting thru the streets. Parents were livid, kids confused, WHERE was the Holiday theme?

293592120,3,2015-07-01,United Kingdom,Very busy (but we knew that it would be!). Space mountain and 2 other rides shut! We queued 40 min for thunder mountain for the ride to break down and be sent away! The next day We also tried to get on the ratatouille ride all day and that was also shut all day due to a breakdown. What shocked me the most was the attitude of many adults in the one Disney parade on Main Street. I thought Disney was for children but many adults think it is perfectly reasonable to knock children out of the way to stand in front of them and block their view or knock them off the pavement! These adults should be ashamed of themselves! Perhaps Disney employees should focus more on getting little children to the front of the pavement so they can see the parade rather than making people stand on the pavement up off the street because most of the time they were making children try and scramble back up into the pavement they had been pushed off!,Disneyland_Paris
263040456,5,2015-03-01,United Kingdom,Disneyland Park is pure magic for children and adults alike. Yes it is chaotic at times but this is to be expected. The attractions are amazing with great things to see and do at every turn. The queues can be slightly tiresome but to be honest the longest we had to queue was 30 minutes so not bad really. The staff at all the rides and attractions are smiley and friendly and try to entertain the kids as much as possible to relieve some of the boredom of queues!Definitely my favourite out of the two parks and i think the one best suited to young children.,Disneyland_Paris

606634498,4,2018-08-01,United Kingdom,"With a username like SheLovesDisney, it's pretty obvious I am a Disneyland fanatic. After several years of happy trips to Disneyland California, this was my first visit to Paris and I wasn't disappointed. I still got that buzz walking down Main Street, and most of my favourite rides were here and just as much fun. Hyperspace Mountain is MUCH quicker than the California version which was a surprise   a good one for me, a bad one for my poor 8 year old who didn't like it at all! My 11 year old and I really enjoyed the Indiana Jones ride which is totally different to California. The parade was lovely, with the smoke breathing dragon a highlight. Fireworks were late for families at 11pm, so we only saw them once, but they were totally worth it. Fewer and simpler fireworks, but much more of a light show. A disappointment was the lack of opportunities for spontaneous character meet and greets   you have to book with an app called Lineberty, which is not well publicized and doesn't seem to stop you having to wait in line anyway.Disneyland in the summer is hot and crowded wherever you go in the world. Wait times are long and you have to plan what you want to do and understand systems like fastpass in advance. if you're not up for the challenge, don't do it! That said, DL Paris is just not as slick as DL California operationally, and there are not as many staff on the ground. Queues formed in awkward places, and the rides were often loaded inefficiently due to lack of staff leading to longer queues than were necessary. Nobody was patrolling the build up to the parade or fireworks, so there was pushing in and confusion over whether you should be seated or standing which just didn't happen in California (in my experience).Overall, we had the usual amazing, exhausting time and I got my Disney fix! California still has my heart, but Paris has a lot of that magic.",Disneyland_Paris

248489683,2,2014-12-01,United States,"We took my 2 small grandkids (ages 6 and 3) to the Happiest Place on Earth for New Year's to enjoy the rides. Got there early and got our 2 strollers, so everyone would make it to fireworks. The first few hours were great hopping on and off rides. By afternoon the place was crowded    okay that's normal. Never could get a place to see the parades    too many people. Late afternoon, you could barely move because they roped off and shut the streets while installing bands. (Hum, I thought this place was about the rides but we stood patiently waiting trying to get across the streets and down sidewalks like the other 85,000  people.) Early evening, people are now body to body against the ropes, rails, and walls. People were trying to push through the crowds and were falling over our strollers against my grandkids. People were angry at being stopped and just being forced to stand in one spot while thousands of others crowded in behind them. Adults were vying on the streets for the best spot to see the NO NAME bands. By 8 p.m. they had closed down the rides because no one could tell where the normally long lines ended or began because every available area had people standing and waiting ... waiting for what? They closed the rides so there was nothing to do but listen to bands    excuse me Disneyland    we didn't go there so we could take our toddlers to a Night Club atmosphere!!! We paid almost $600 for one day, so we could ride the rides, see the parades, and watch fireworks. My grandchildren only saw the backs of the legs of the people standing in the crowd in front of them who were at a dead halt hoping to see the bands. It took us 2 hours to make it from the Castle down Main Street to the gate. If there had been any kind of emergency, we would all have been crushed by people trying to get out. You expect crowds at Disneyland if you've ever gone there before. I've worked in security and crowd control for years, and believe Disneyland did not have adequate crowd control plans or people to handle such an event. If they repeat this next year, they can advertise Disney's new event and call it a  Frightmare on Main Street !!!!",Disneyland_California

In the end, we opted for the latter  and were glad we did. We hopped between the two parks 2 or 3 times to get to rides and shows that we wanted to  and only left when the park closed at 10pm.

370718905,5,2016-04-01,United States,"As a  WDW person , I was really nervous going into Disneyland for the first time. I was afraid I was going to hate it because it was smaller with less to do, and much less vast than its Florida cousin. Or worse   I was afraid I was going to love it so much that I'd come back to Walt Disney World and hate everything. But neither of those things happened. What did happen   I gained a new appreciation for the parks in Florida that I've grown used to. I noticed how things were done differently in California. I got to see a completely new perspective on rides and characters that I thought I knew like the back of my hand. I didn't come out of Disneyland underwhelmed or hating Disney World. I came out loving both of them for very different reasons. I don't think it's fair to compare it to Walt Disney World because honestly, they're very different places and both deserve to be appreciated in their own right. But I absolutely fell in love with Disneyland. It was so interesting to see the differences and feel the rich history of the park. It was very surreal to think that some of these attractions and places have remained mostly unchanged for the past 60 years   it's just unreal. I was lucky to attend during the Diamond Celebration and I feel it was a great way to experience the park for the first time. It was amazing to see a park that so many people were so proud of. It's just a different atmosphere than anything else I've experienced. Yes, it's small, and can be crowded, and some rides were down when we visited   but for me it was all about the experience. As a person who likes to go go go on vacations, I was afraid we weren't going to be able to do everything. But this vacation I was actually able to slow down and just take everything in, and it was amazing. There's nothing quite like the experience of walking into a Disney park for the first time. It's pure magic. And on my first trip to Disneyland (at the ripe old age of 23) I cried, I took it all in, and I felt the magic again.And I cant wait to go back  3",Disneyland_California

209105916,4,2014-05-01,Austria,"I had no idea what to expect!!Although it was British half term week, I never had that horrid feeling of being penned in or it being over crowded, it was a very comfortable feeling and a nice place to be. I also was a bit worried before about losing the children, but never once did we lose sight or have that uncomfortable feeling of being separated. There are parts of DL that look like they need a coat of paint, but how would they do that when it is open all year? And if they closed rides to do that, folks would be disappointed. The toilets were plentiful and we only queued once, but they pong, even the ladies!!! The toilets are also well hidden, so you have to keep your eyes open, or follow your nose!!Food in DL is horrid!!! I have never eaten so much junk, and such expensive junk!! My tip is to stay in a self catered place like the Marriott Village and make your own pack ups to eat in the picnic areas and then eat  big  at home in the evening, or go off site. We went off site to PLanet Hollywood one lunchtime and it was no more expensive and the food was better.Don't bother queueing up to see a Princess! What a con!! We were there in the queue at 10am, waited till the ticket office opened at 10.30, got a ticket with a set time to come back (1.15pm), got back and even with an  appointment  we had to wait over 75 minutes before my granddaughter said  Let's go, I can't do this , so she never even met a Princess!I expected to see more DL characters wandering around, but in 4 days, we only saw 2 mice from Cinderella and some Mary Poppins people. I think for safety reasons they cant have characters wandering around in case of crowd crushes. Most of the staff spoke good English and all were very helpful and friendly. The place was spotless, as soon as anything was dropped on the floor, a team were there sweeping up.On day 1, we did a 13 hour day, going from 1 ride to another, my legs felt like I had run a marathon (we didn't queue because my grandson has a disable pass). We were shattered!! Couldn't even stay for the fireworks at 11pm! My suggestion is that after the parade at 5,30pm, everyone goes off site back to their hotels for dinner, a rest and shower before coming back at 9.30pm for the firworks. This makes it a nice peaceful time to enjoy small queues for rides, but be ware, some restaurants close at 5pm and so do some rides. If you want to see the parade, you have to sit on your patch of pavement at least 1 hour before!!!! Take a cushion!All in all, a once in a lifetime trip, but take your vitamins beforehand!!",Disneyland_Paris

349551723,5,2016-01-01,Australia,"As a kid in 1960s Australia, I was glued to the TV for the Sunday night Disneyland show, where I heard about Frontierland, Tomorrowland, Adventureland and  Fantasyland, the happiest kingdom of them all . It took me many years to see this wondrous place, and I have been back as often as I can afford. Every trip is another holiday away from the everyday, as you step into a bubble of time and space, where your cares are left behind, and the Disney magic envelopes you. Admittedly, so does a crowd of tens of thousands of others seeking the same magic! So you need to plan to make the most of your time (and money), and not get swamped by the hordes and spoil your magical day.Although I knew it was a risk, I chose to go in the week after New Year, so I could see the last of the holiday decorations and the holiday overlays on Haunted Mansion, Small World and the Jingle Cruise (no, that is not a typo!). And yes, it was certainly crowded! We got a 5 day park hopper ticket, which also took the pressure off feeling we had to spend every minute at the park, and we could pace ourselves. We pre booked some dining packages to ensure we had guaranteed seats for Fantasmic (wonderful show, now on hiatus), and World of Color in DCA. We had one Early Magic Morning, and made the most of that one hour, managing to ride on Star Tours, Hyperspace Mountain, Peter Pan (otherwise an insanely long queue for such a short but beautiful ride), Alice in Wonderland, and several others. Another hour of catching rides with shorter lines (use an app such as Touring Plans to check real time updates), and we were ready for a leisurely breakfast at the River Belle, another ride or two (old favourites such as Pirates of the Caribbean and Haunted Mansion) then back to our hotel for a long break. We returned early in the evening in time for the fabulous Paint the Night Parade, Fantasmic and the fireworks, all of which were spectacular. With the energy from taking a break, we could stay until close to park closing at midnight. When it poured with rain the next day, I was so glad we had done so many things on our first day! While the rain reduced the lines dramatically, it was far too wet for my comfort and we did not stay as long. It was worth it to see the Halloween   Holidays overlay at Haunted Mansion with Nightmare before Xmas   it suits the attraction so well. It was a nice change hearing Christmas Carols at It's a Small world, as was seeing the animated dolls in their holiday garb. And who would have thought it would work to theme the Jungle Cruise for Christmas?! More opportunities for those classic lame jokes. However the best of the holiday decor was the huge Christmas tree in Main Street, and the lighting for Small World (Christmas red and green lights instead of the gold and white). With Christmas themed food and treats, Christmassy smells, and everything lit up with millions of fairy lights, it really was a wonderland. As I use a mobility scooter, it is much more challenging in the crowded times as people walk right into you (while reading their mobile phones and not looking), kids tend to run in front of you, and it can be more stressful. One of the many things I love about Disney is that they make it as easy as possible to forget about the hassles, and enjoy yourself. The cast members at every ride were excellent, offering thoughtful suggestions for how to get into the various ride vehicles most easily; several allowed me to ride a second time straight away, as it had been difficult to enter the vehicle. Several of the restaurants let me ride up to my table and then the staff took the scooter for me and parked it, and brought it back at the end of the meal. For the parades, there are special roped off areas, policed by staff members, for those in wheelchairs and scooters, to ensure you can have a good view of the parades from a seated position. Don't let your disability deter you, Disney is the best in the world at making it as easy as possible so everyone equally can enjoy the magic.",Disneyland_California

The feeling I had looking at my daughter's faces while experience the park was priceless. we r able to try most rides and can go from one area to the others without getting to tired. the park also offer a lot of food to eat. the fireworks was the highlight of our trip. so entertaining and very nicely done. So overall very nice and magical experience. cant wait to visit it again.",Disneyland_HongKong
370354859,5,2015-06-01,Bahrain,"Something magical about Disneyland, no matter how many times you go to their park, you feel like you were as young as when you were in school.The park is not as big as the US, but has many attractions and games for the whole family. If you're going there without children then a daytrip shall do to finish both parks. If you are with children then staying 2 3 nights at the hotels there will be a better idea.",Disneyland_Paris
362033693,4,2016-04-01,Norway,"We had a nice day, but I was very disappointed to find out that they had closed down the Grizzly Grouch as well as a few other attractions for renovation. Also we were lined up for the Autopia but they closed the thing due to weather reports about thunder clouds.. safety first but hello we can survive a few drops of rain.. The Space Mountain however was amazing, did ride it 2 times. The shows were also amazing, especially Festival of The Lion King was incredibly good!! The Mickey and the Wondrous Book show however was partly in Chinese, so make sure to sit on the right side or middle so you can see right monitor where they text it (left side monitor is Chinese only). Flights of Fantasy Parade was great! Just position yourself early to have the beast view. We did Main Street, but I recommend doing the left side of circle looking towards the castle, as the parade stops for quite some time there and perform dances for you to enjoy. Sadly they cancelled the Disney Paint The Night parade..... I wish they would give me a new ticket to watch this.. but they were scared of rain... however it did not rain so much after all..... that sucked.. anyways the fireworks was the best I've ever seen, mainly due to its timing and quality, the brightest and clearest and most colorful fireworks I've ever seen... amazing!",Disneyland_HongKong
206313771,5,2014-05-01,United Kingdom,"It's Disneyland, what do you expect?It is super fun for everyone not just children. The food can be pricey and the opening times for some places vary (some are open 11 3 and some open from 3:30 midnight). It's best to get your food from the Disney Village.We went on just about every ride! The queue times for the parachute drop is poor. The people working on there don't seem to be making an effort to get people on and off the ride quickly. The queue time said 35minutes... we waited an hour.Everything else was perfect!",Disneyland_Paris
586921995,5,2018-04-01,United Arab Emirates,"Mention Disney, and most immediately think crazy crowds along with Disney Magic. Hong Kong Disneyland is one of my favorite parks because it strikes the perfect balance retaining the magic and charm that we have come to expect from a Disney Park while also having lower than normal (for Disney) crowds! Be sure to avoid weekends and holidays (I only went during non Holiday weekdays) when I hear that crowds can be much thicker, and you will enjoy shorter wait times, the ability to randomly catch a parade or show, and the opportunity to take it all in at a leisurely pace. This Disney fanatic recommends two days to be able to experience EVERYTHING in the park (all the rides, shows, parades and a couple of repeat rides on your favorites) but I realize that I am the exception and that most could do the park well enough in a single day. The unique to Hong Kong Disney rides are definitely worth going out of your way to experience if you are in the area and a fan of Disney at all. For our family, it was simply magical!",Disneyland_HongKong
200736762,5,2014-04-01,United Kingdom,Great short break. Definitely a trip for all the family. We had a wonderful shirt break. Kids loved it.,Disneyland_Paris
281732731,4,2015-05-01,United Kingdom,"The park itself is fantastic! However, we found out beforehand that there were going to be a couple of closed rides for maintenance. However there were more closed than we expected. There were also quite a few technical problems, especially with Big Thunder Mountain. We once queued for 30 minutes and then had to leave due to technical problems when we were right at the front. Surely, those waiting for more than 15 minutes (or right in the main waiting area) could have been given a fast pass for when it re opened. Surely this must be easy enough to calculate as they can tell you how long the wait is from certain points",Disneyland_Paris

I say 1 whole day to cover the area, 2 days to enjoy parades and rides and 3 whole days to enjoy all attractions and shows!

319848857,4,2015-10-01,United Kingdom,"Had an amazing day at Disneyland Paris and everything was very nice! However, one annoying thing was that there was not enough signposting around the park showing each ride and area, and the map wasn't very clear! The places to eat weren't up to the standard I expected fromDisneyland, especially considering the extortionate price!",Disneyland_Paris
313175592,4,2015-09-01,Australia,We went in early Sept ( 2 Adults and 2 kids) had a great time.Had a 2 day pass not sure you really need 2 days we could have do it in 1 but was nice not having to rush around alot of walking the rides are aimed at smaller kids (i think) but still sum scary rides as well don;t get me wrong .Sum thing for all ages .We were lucky didnt have to wait long in lines(5 10 min).The shows are good we love the 3 d movie.You have to be early to get a seat at shows busy. Lots for toliets (very clean)and food places.,Disneyland_HongKong
550010237,3,2017-12-01,United Kingdom,"We did 26 29 Dec ... not the brightest idea ... it was cold, it was wet and it was very, very busy. The time to go is when the people of Paris are hard at work and it   s warm ... avoid the school holidays, Christmas and Oct Mar. Having said this we were a group of eight and we had a great time ... there is always Disney magic whatever the weather ... just think carefully about the best time to go.",Disneyland_Paris
370119060,5,2016-04-01,United States,There's only one Disneyland which makes sense why it is so crowded. Get in early and get some fastpasses unless you want to wait in 1.5 hr lines.,Disneyland_California

612987131,5,2018-08-01,United States,"This was a special girls trip with my bestie to celebrate her birthday! I hadn't been to visit in 6 years and it felt so good to be back! We stopped in City Hall to talk about disability accommodations. I have a hard time standing on my feet for long periods of time and walking a lot. I knew from previous visits that Disneyland has accommodations for disabled and special needs kids. For certain rides, you use a special entrance (usually the exit) and a cast member works you into the regular line or gives you a time to return. Unfortunately, I was met with a cast member that didn't embody the Disney way and refused to help me. (I don't look disabled, which shouldn't matter anyway)* After being refused. We decided to hit the park anyway. I ended up renting a scooter at the Disneyland hotel. Totally worth it.The park wasn't super crowded considering it was mid August. It was super hot, though and rather smokey due to the fires. We had 3 day passes with park hopper and max pass. The max pass gets you unlimited pics from the Disneyland photographers. That was totally worth the cost. You download the app and get your QR code that the photographer scans after taking your pictures. I screenshot the code so I could easily find it and didn't have to open the app every time. The app also gave us the wait times for rides and we were able to make some plans. My friend is gluten free and while there are tons of gluten free options in the park, the app doesn't show those options on the menu. What you need to do is ask at each restaurant when ordering and then they let you know what you can order. The options were super yummy and never repeated which was fantastic, they really are progressive when it comes to options. My only sadness, many of the cast members were cranky and it was very un Disney like. It was such a fantastic trip!",Disneyland_California

There is a new ride Monster Inc (wasnt there when we went back in Feb).Tips: wear comfortable shoes and bring your own food, bring your own water bottle and fill up thereweather was nice, not hot at all, night time in california around this time is chilly (5 7 degrees celsius) so bring a warm jacket for you and the kids.",Disneyland_California

Even our 11 month granddaughter was captivated by Its a Small World and our 5 year grandson bravely took on Tower of Terror. With enough to last all day and then more, this is a richly entertaining place. The Disney Parade was every bit as good as the flashy Florida version and the closing show, with lights, fountains and fireworks was simply... magical.",Disneyland_Paris

654308388,4,2019-02-01,Canada,Took my family and grandkids to Disneyland. For many this was their first time in Disneyland. It is very clean and well organized. Our granddaughter had her 10th birthday when we were there and wore a button stating it was her birthday. So many staff and characters recognized her birthday which she really enjoyed and will remember forever. We found rides to be excellent and staff were very accommodating. Use of  fast pass  on rides worked well. Only complaint is that we were only allowed to visit one park per day as per our ticket. We were able to take in food and drinks for the young kids which helped keep the expense down.,Disneyland_California
